	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based emotion recognition using various kinds of data has attracted vast attention in recent years. Impressive results have been achieved, but only recently the influence of the training data with its potential biases and variations in annotation quality are discussed. Still, the majority of the research literature focuses on improving machine learning techniques and model performance using single data sets. Literature on the impact of training data remains scarce. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the influence of the training data on the accuracy of recognizing emotional states in facial expressions by a comparative evaluation, using multiple established facial image databases. Results reveal inconsistencies in the data annotations as well as ambiguities in the emotional states expressed. Thus, they allow to critically discuss data quality of the training data, contributing to a more in-depth understanding of previous emotion recognition approaches, and improving the design of more transparent AI solutions.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the Pointer Value Retrieval (PVR) benchmark introduced in [ZRKB21], where a 'reasoning' function acts on a string of digits to produce the label. More generally, the paper considers the learning of logical functions with gradient descent (GD) on neural networks. It is first shown that in order to learn logical functions with gradient descent on symmetric neural networks, the generalization error can be lower-bounded in terms of the noise-stability of the target function, supporting a conjecture made in [ZRKB21]. It is then shown that in the distribution shift setting, when the data withholding corresponds to freezing a single feature (referred to as canonical holdout), the generalization error of gradient descent admits a tight characterization in terms of the Boolean influence for several relevant architectures. This is shown on linear models and supported experimentally on other models such as MLPs and Transformers. In particular, this puts forward the hypothesis that for such architectures and for learning logical functions such as PVR functions, GD tends to have an implicit bias towards low-degree representations, which in turn gives the Boolean influence for the generalization error under quadratic loss.},

  abstract = {One of the main challenges facing the current approaches of speech emotion recognition is the lack of a dataset large enough to train the currently available deep learning models properly. Therefore, this paper proposes a new data augmentation algorithm to enrich the speech emotions dataset with more sam Department, College of Computing and ples through a careful addition of noise fractions. In addition, the hyperparameters of the currently available deep learning models are either handcrafted or adjusted during the training process. However, this approach does not guarantee finding the best settings for these parameters. Therefore, we propose an optimized deep learning model in which the hyperparameters are optimized to find their best settings and thus achieve more recognition results. This deep learning model consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) composed of four local feature-learning blocks and a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer for learning local and long-term correlations in the log Mel-spectrogram of the input speech samples. To improve the performance of this deep network, the learning rate and label smoothing regularization factor are optimized using the recently emerged stochastic fractal search (SFS)-guided whale optimization algorithm (WOA). The strength of this algorithm is the ability to balance between the exploration and exploitation of the search agents' positions to guarantee to reach the optimal global solution. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach, four speech emotion datasets, namely, IEMOCAP, Emo-DB, RAVDESS, and SAVEE, are incorporated in the conducted experiments. Experimental results confirmed the superiority of the proposed approach when compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Based on the four datasets, the achieved recognition accuracies are 98.13\%, 99.76\%, 99.47\%, and 99.50\%, respectively. Moreover, a statistical analysis of the achieved results is provided to emphasize the stability of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Neural models and symbolic algorithms have recently been combined for tasks requiring both perception and reasoning. Neural models ground perceptual input into a conceptual vocabulary, on which a classical reasoning algorithm is applied to generate output. A key limitation is that such neural-to-symbolic models can only be trained end-to-end for tasks where the output space is symbolic. In this paper, we study neural-symbolic-neural models for reasoning tasks that require a conversion from an image input (e.g., a partially filled sudoku) to an image output (e.g., the image of the completed sudoku). While designing such a three-step hybrid architecture may be straightforward, the key technical challenge is end-to-end training -- how to backpropagate without intermediate supervision through the symbolic component. We propose NSNnet, an architecture that combines an image reconstruction loss with a novel output encoder to generate a supervisory signal, develops update algorithms that leverage policy gradient methods for supervision, and optimizes loss using a novel subsampling heuristic. We experiment on problem settings where symbolic algorithms are easily specified: a visual maze solving task and a visual Sudoku solver where the supervision is in image form. Experiments show high accuracy with significantly less data compared to purely neural approaches.},

  abstract = {Neuro-symbolic representations have proved effective in learning structure information in vision and language. In this paper, we propose a new model architecture for learning multi-modal neuro-symbolic representations for video captioning. Our approach uses a dictionary learning-based method of learning relations between videos and their paired text descriptions. We refer to these relations as relative roles and leverage them to make each token role-aware using attention. This results in a more structured and interpretable architecture that incorporates modality-specific inductive biases for the captioning task. Intuitively, the model is able to learn spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relations in a given pair of video and text. The disentanglement achieved by our proposal gives the model more capacity to capture multi-modal structures which result in captions with higher quality for videos. Our experiments on two established video captioning datasets verifies the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on automatic metrics. We further conduct a human evaluation to measure the grounding and relevance of the generated captions and observe consistent improvement for the proposed model.

They are playing a key role in intelligent visual surveillance systems and have widespread applications like applications for public security. The person Re-ID systems can identify if a person has been seen by a non-overlapping camera over large camera network in an unconstrained environment. It is a challenging issue since a person appears differently under different camera views and faces many challenges such as pose variation, occlusion and illumination changes. Many methods had been introduced for generating handcrafted features aimed to handle the person Re-ID problem. In recent years, many studies have started to apply deep learning methods to enhance the person Re-ID performance due the deep learning yielded significant results in computer vision issues. Therefore, this paper is a survey of the recent studies that proposed to improve the person Re-ID systems using deep learning. The public datasets that are used for evaluating these systems are discussed. Finally, the paper addresses future directions and current issues that must be considered toward improving the person Re-ID systems.},

The significant developments in satellite-based techniques, sensors, telecommunications, computer hardware and software, image processing, etc. positively influenced to solve the positioning problem efficiently and instantaneously. Accordingly, the mentioned development empowered the applications and advancement of autonomous navigation. One of the most interesting developed positioning techniques is what is called in robotics as the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping SLAM. The SLAM problem solution has witnessed a quick improvement in the last decades either using active sensors like the RAdio Detection And Ranging (Radar) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) or passive sensors like cameras. Definitely, positioning and mapping is one of the main tasks for Geomatics engineers, and therefore it's of high importance for them to understand the SLAM topic which is not easy because of the huge documentation and algorithms available and the various SLAM solutions in terms of the mathematical models, complexity, the sensors used, and the type of applications. In this paper, a clear and simplified explanation is introduced about SLAM from a Geomatical viewpoint avoiding going into the complicated algorithmic details behind the presented techniques. In this way, a general overview of SLAM is presented showing the relationship between its different components and stages like the core part of the front-end and back-end and their relation to the SLAM paradigm. Furthermore, we explain the major mathematical techniques of filtering and pose graph optimization either using visual or LiDAR SLAM and introduce a summary of the deep learning efficient contribution to the SLAM problem. Finally, we address examples of some existing practical applications of SLAM in our reality.},

  abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a dominant deep-learning paradigm for various tasks in which complex policies are learned within reactive systems. In parallel, there has recently been significant research on verifying deep neural networks. However, to date, there has been little work demonstrating the use of modern verification tools on real, DRL-controlled systems. In this case-study paper, we attempt to begin bridging this gap, and focus on the important task of mapless robotic navigation -- a classic robotics problem, in which a robot, usually controlled by a DRL agent, needs to efficiently and safely navigate through an unknown arena towards a desired target. We demonstrate how modern verification engines can be used for effective model selection, i.e., the process of selecting the best available policy for the robot in question from a pool of candidate policies. Specifically, we use verification to detect and rule out policies that may demonstrate suboptimal behavior, such as collisions and infinite loops. We also apply verification to identify models with overly conservative behavior, thus allowing users to choose superior policies that are better at finding an optimal, shorter path to a target. To validate our work, we conducted extensive experiments on an actual robot, and confirmed that the suboptimal policies detected by our method were indeed flawed. We also compared our verification-driven approach to state-of-the-art gradient attacks, and our results demonstrate that gradient-based methods are inadequate in this setting. Our work is the first to demonstrate the use of DNN verification backends for recognizing suboptimal DRL policies in real-world robots, and for filtering out unwanted policies. We believe that the methods presented in this work can be applied to a large range of application domains that incorporate deep-learning-based agents.},

  abstract = {With the aim of getting understandable symbolic rules to explain a given phenomenon, we split the task of learning these rules from sensory data in two phases: a multilayer perceptron maps features into propositional variables and a set of subsequent layers operated by a PAC-like algorithm learns Boolean expressions on these variables. The special features of this procedure are that: i) the neural network is trained to produce a Boolean output having the principal task of discriminating between classes of inputs; ii) the symbolic part is directed to compute rules within a family that is not known a priori; iii) the welding point between the two learning systems is represented by a feedback based on a suitability evaluation of the computed rules. The procedure we propose is based on a computational learning paradigm set up recently in some papers in the fields of theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence and cognitive systems. The present article focuses on information management aspects of the procedure. We deal with the lack of prior information about the rules through learning strategies that affect both the meaning of the variables and the description length of the rules into which they combine. The paper uses the task of learning to formally discriminate among several emotional states as both a working example and a test bench for a comparison with previous symbolic and subsymbolic methods in the field.},

  abstract = {The study of human emotions has been significantly important in recent years, mainly due to its incidence in human behavior. Additionally, having semantic tools that infer emotions from multisensory sources is a crucial aspect, especially because the feelings or actions of a person might be identified through these semantic tools. In the present research, a methodology that uses semantic structures is proposed in order to identify complex emotions on the basis of simple emotions. For this purpose, the SHEO ontology was used. This ontology is designed to conceptualize simple emotions, combine them, and work with axioms and rules that infer complex emotions. SHEO takes simple emotions as instances. These emotions can be identified using computer algorithms. This is demonstrated in the testing phase in which the authors of this research designed the software called DetectionEmotion, which is used to identify simple emotions in video and text. The result of the authors' proposal proved the easiness to infer complex emotions by using SHEO. SHEO is not a final solution in this research, but rather a contribution to the semantic management of emotions.},

In this paper, we contribute to the ongoing discussion on the use of intellectual property analytics methods, i.e artificial intelligence methods, machine learning and deep learning approaches, to analyse intellectual property data. This literature review follows a narrative approach with search strategy, where we present the state-of-the-art in intellectual property analytics by reviewing 57 recent articles. The bibliographic information of the articles are analysed, followed by a discussion of the articles divided in four main categories: knowledge management, technology management, economic value, and extraction and effective management of information. We hope research scholars and industrial users, may find this review helpful when searching for the latest research efforts pertaining to intellectual property analytics.},

With the great success of machine learning, researchers are working day and night to interpret facial expressions having emotions like sadness, anger, happiness, etc. Although, in the topical research on facial identification, there are numerous issues such as low lustiness and indigent abstraction of recognition system. This paper depicts how people use their facial emotions to describe their situation and at the same time use the same emotions that imply whether they are happy or sad, upset or normal, etc. that is quite challenging to predict one's mood as multiple emotions are taken into account for distinguished problems which have impacted the performance of many existing systems proposed so far. In addition, this paper also analyzesa few machine learning algorithms along with feature extraction techniques that would benefit us in the unerring identification of human emotion.},

Most studies explore data-driven pattern recognition techniques that are generally highly dependent on learning data and insufficiently effective for emotion contextual recognition. In this article, a hybrid model-based emotion contextual recognition approach for cognitive assistance services in ubiquitous environments is proposed. This model is based on: 1) a hybrid-level fusion exploiting a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural-network model and the possibilistic logic and 2) an expressive emotional knowledge representation and reasoning model to recognize nondirectly observable emotions; this model exploits jointly the emotion upper ontology (EmUO) and the n-ary ontology of events HTemp supported by the NKRL language. For validation purposes of the proposed approach, experiments were carried out using a YouTube dataset, and in a real-world scenario dedicated to the cognitive assistance of visitors in a smart devices showroom. Results demonstrated that the proposed multimodal emotion recognition model outperforms all baseline models. The real-world scenario corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of emotion contextual recognition and management and in the creation of emotion-based assistance services.},

The specific methodology introduced integrates morphological processing and machine learning techniques such as genetic algorithms (GAs) and empirical inductive generalization. The optimal operators (defined as variable morphological structuring elements) evolved by GAs are used to derive discriminant feature vectors, which are then used by empirical inductive learning to generate rule-based class description in disjunctive normal form. The rule-based descriptions are finally optimized by removing small disjuncts in order to enhance the robustness of the shape analysis system. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the feasibility of the methodology for discriminating among classes of arbitrarily shaped objects, for learning the concepts of convexity and concavity, and for building robust recognition methods.{$<>$}},

Although SSL has recently reached a milestone: outperforming supervised methods in many modalities\textbackslash dots the theoretical foundations are limited, method-specific, and fail to provide principled design guidelines to practitioners. In this paper, we propose a unifying framework under the helm of spectral manifold learning to address those limitations. Through the course of this study, we will rigorously demonstrate that VICReg, SimCLR, BarlowTwins et al. correspond to eponymous spectral methods such as Laplacian Eigenmaps, Multidimensional Scaling et al. This unification will then allow us to obtain (i) the closed-form optimal representation for each method, (ii) the closed-form optimal network parameters in the linear regime for each method, (iii) the impact of the pairwise relations used during training on each of those quantities and on downstream task performances, and most importantly, (iv) the first theoretical bridge between contrastive and non-contrastive methods towards global and local spectral embedding methods respectively, hinting at the benefits and limitations of each. For example, (i) if the pairwise relation is aligned with the downstream task, any SSL method can be employed successfully and will recover the supervised method, but in the low data regime, VICReg's invariance hyper-parameter should be high; (ii) if the pairwise relation is misaligned with the downstream task, VICReg with small invariance hyper-parameter should be preferred over SimCLR or BarlowTwins.},

  abstract = {The tension between deduction and induction is perhaps the most fundamental issue in areas such as philosophy, cognition and artificial intelligence (AI). The deduction camp concerns itself with questions about the expressiveness of formal languages for capturing knowledge about the world, together with proof systems for reasoning from such knowledge bases. The learning camp attempts to generalize from examples about partial descriptions about the world. In AI, historically, these camps have loosely divided the development of the field, but advances in cross-over areas such as statistical relational learning, neuro-symbolic systems, and high-level control have illustrated that the dichotomy is not very constructive, and perhaps even ill-formed. In this article, we survey work that provides further evidence for the connections between logic and learning. Our narrative is structured in terms of three strands: logic versus learning, machine learning for logic, and logic for machine learning, but naturally, there is considerable overlap. We place an emphasis on the following "sore" point: there is a common misconception that logic is for discrete properties, whereas probability theory and machine learning, more generally, is for continuous properties. We report on results that challenge this view on the limitations of logic, and expose the role that logic can play for learning in infinite domains.},

  abstract = {We present lambda layers -- an alternative framework to self-attention -- for capturing long-range interactions between an input and structured contextual information (e.g. a pixel surrounded by other pixels). Lambda layers capture such interactions by transforming available contexts into linear functions, termed lambdas, and applying these linear functions to each input separately. Similar to linear attention, lambda layers bypass expensive attention maps, but in contrast, they model both content and position-based interactions which enables their application to large structured inputs such as images. The resulting neural network architectures, LambdaNetworks, significantly outperform their convolutional and attentional counterparts on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection and COCO instance segmentation, while being more computationally efficient. Additionally, we design LambdaResNets, a family of hybrid architectures across different scales, that considerably improves the speed-accuracy tradeoff of image classification models. LambdaResNets reach excellent accuracies on ImageNet while being 3.2 - 4.4x faster than the popular EfficientNets on modern machine learning accelerators. When training with an additional 130M pseudo-labeled images, LambdaResNets achieve up to a 9.5x speed-up over the corresponding EfficientNet checkpoints.},

In attempting to determine emotion felt by another person, the bodily expresson of their emotion is the only evidence directly available, eg, ``John looks angry''. Our motivation in this paper is to bring context into the emotion-modulating cognitive input, eg, we know that John is a generally calm person, so we can conclude from expression (anger) plus context (calm) that John is not only angry, but that ``John must be furious''. We use a well known interoperable reasoning tool, an ontology, to bring context into the implementation of the emotion detection process. Our emotion ontology (EmOCA) allow us to describe and to reason about philia and phobia in order to modulate emotion determined from expression. We present an experiment suggesting that people use such a strategy to incorporate contextual information when determining what emotion another person may be feeling.},

The present study evaluates stimulus-dependent structure in spontaneous eye-blink behavior as an objective, corroborative measure for the media use phenomenon of spatial presence. To this end, a mixed methods approach is used in an experimental setting to collect, combine, analyze, and interpret data from standardized participant self-report, observation of participant behavior, and content analysis of the media stimulus. T-pattern detection is used to analyze stimulus-dependent blinking behavior, and this structural data is then contrasted with self-report data. The combined results show that behavioral indicators yield the predicted results, while self-report data shows unpredicted results that are not predicted by the underlying theory. The use of a mixed methods approach offered insights that support further theory development and theory testing beyond a traditional, mono-method experimental approach.},

Research rather suggests that blink timing, and thus the structure of blinking behavior, is influenced by cognitive processes, such as attention. Since attention is regarded a necessary precursor of media use phenomena, the present study investigates the relation between the structure of blinking behavior and the media use phenomenon of spatial presence. To this end, spontaneous eye-blinks have been observed in an experiment during the reception of a video story. The methods of T-pattern analysis, ISI distance, and IBI variability have been used to quantify stimulus-dependent blink structure, which has then been related to self-reports of spatial presence experiences. While the T-pattern analysis and ISI distance showed converging results for behavior structure, a hypothesized relation between more stimulus-dependent blink structure and stronger presence experiences was not found. On the contrary, blink data suggested a difference in attention allocation, whereas self-report data indicated no difference in presence experiences. This demonstrates that beyond self-report and the analysis of event frequencies, the analysis of behavior structure offers insights into behavior synchronization between participants, allowing for new inferences on internal processing of media stimuli.},

In its original photographic format, the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) has been frequently utilized. In the current study, we validate a dynamic version of this database, the KDEF-dyn. To this end, we applied animation between neutral and emotional expressions (happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, and surprised; 1,033-ms unfolding) to 40 KDEF models, with morphing software. Ninety-six human observers categorized the expressions of the resulting 240 video-clip stimuli, and automated face analysis assessed the evidence for 6 expressions and 20 facial action units (AUs) at 31 intensities. Low-level image properties (luminance, signal-to-noise ratio, etc.) and other purely perceptual factors (e.g., size, unfolding speed) were controlled. Human recognition performance (accuracy, efficiency, and confusions) patterns were consistent with prior research using static and other dynamic expressions. Automated assessment of expressions and AUs was sensitive to intensity manipulations. Significant correlations emerged between human observers' categorization and automated classification. The KDEF-dyn database aims to provide a balance between experimental control and ecological validity for research on emotional facial expression processing. The stimuli and the validation data are available to the scientific community.},

The paper proposes a new system for emotion classification based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) classifier. The generative adversarial networks have been widely used for generating realistic images, but the classification capabilities have been vaguely exploited. One of the main advantages is that by using the generator, we can extend our testing dataset and add more variety to each of the seven emotion classes we try to identify. Thus, the novelty of our study consists in increasing the number of classes from N to 2N (in the learning phase) by considering real and fake emotions. Facial key points are obtained from real and generated facial images, and vectors connecting them with the facial center of gravity are used by the discriminator to classify the image as one of the 14 classes of interest (real and fake for seven emotions). As another contribution, real images from different emotional classes are used in the generation process unlike the classical GAN approach which generates images from simple noise arrays. By using the proposed method, our system can classify emotions in facial images regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age and face rotation. An accuracy of 75.2\% was obtained on 7000 real images (14,000, also considering the generated images) from multiple combined facial datasets.},

  abstract = {An approach of robust localization for mobile robot working in indoor is proposed in this paper. A novel method for laser SLAM and visual SLAM fusion is introduced to provide robust localization. This architecture can be applied to a situation where any two kinds of laser-based SLAM and monocular camera-based SLAM can be fused together instead of being limited to single specific SLAM algorithm. While laser-based SLAM and monocular camera-based SLAM have their own strengths and drawbacks, the integration of these two kinds of SLAM algorithm can then promote the algorithmic effectiveness. Instead of using feature matching methods to achieve fusion procedure, trajectories matching is proposed with an attempt to achieve the generalization over all different kinds of SLAM algorithms, since localization is a natural function associated with any SLAM algorithm. It turns out that the hereby proposed approach is very lightweight during the run time, and the calculation can run in real-time without unnecessary computation waste. The experimental results show the localization error in terms of the real distance can be less than 5\%. Furthermore, through the experiment the proposed system can be shown able to improve the localization when the sensors are not very powerful.},

However, the task of forming and training models largely remains traditional with a dependency on domain experts and time-consuming data manipulation operations, which impedes the development of machine learning models in both academia as well as industry. This demand advocates the new research era concerned with fitting machine learning models fully automatically i.e., AutoML. Automated Machine Learning(AutoML) is an end-to-end process that aims at automating this model development pipeline without any external assistance. First, we provide an insights of AutoML. Second, we delve into the individual segments in the AutoML pipeline and cover their approaches in brief. We also provide a case study on the industrial use and impact of AutoML with a focus on practical applicability in a business context. At last, we conclude with the open research issues, and future research directions.},

  abstract = {Significance             Humans often use facial expressions to communicate social messages. However, observational studies report that people experiencing pain or orgasm produce facial expressions that are indistinguishable, which questions their role as an effective tool for communication. Here, we investigate this counterintuitive finding using a new data-driven approach to model the mental representations of facial expressions of pain and orgasm in individuals from two different cultures. Using complementary analyses, we show that representations of pain and orgasm are distinct in each culture. We also show that pain is represented with similar face movements across cultures, whereas orgasm shows differences. Our findings therefore inform understanding of the possible communicative role of facial expressions of pain and orgasm, and how culture could shape their representation.           ,              Real-world studies show that the facial expressions produced during pain and orgasm\textemdash two different and intense affective experiences\textemdash are virtually indistinguishable. However, this finding is counterintuitive, because facial expressions are widely considered to be a powerful tool for social interaction. Consequently, debate continues as to whether the facial expressions of these extreme positive and negative affective states serve a communicative function. Here, we address this debate from a novel angle by modeling the mental representations of dynamic facial expressions of pain and orgasm in 40 observers in each of two cultures (Western, East Asian) using a data-driven method. Using a complementary approach of machine learning, an information-theoretic analysis, and a human perceptual discrimination task, we show that mental representations of pain and orgasm are physically and perceptually distinct in each culture. Cross-cultural comparisons also revealed that pain is represented by similar face movements across cultures, whereas orgasm showed distinct cultural accents. Together, our data show that mental representations of the facial expressions of pain and orgasm are distinct, which questions their nondiagnosticity and instead suggests they could be used for communicative purposes. Our results also highlight the potential role of cultural and perceptual factors in shaping the mental representation of these facial expressions. We discuss new research directions to further explore their relationship to the production of facial expressions.},

The results are reported with several baseline approaches using various feature extraction techniques and machine-learning algorithms. First, we collected a dataset from 11 human subjects expressing six basic emotions and one neutral emotion. We then extracted features from each modality using principal component analysis, autoencoder, convolution network, and mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC), some unique to individual modalities. A number of baseline models have been applied to compare the classification performance in emotion recognition, including k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), random forest, multilayer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM) model, and convolutional neural network (CNN). Our results show that bootstrapping the biosensor signals (i.e., EMG and EEG) can greatly increase emotion classification performance by reducing noise. In contrast, the best classification results were obtained by a traditional KNN, whereas audio and image sequences of human emotions could be better classified using LSTM.},

  abstract = {Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) remains to be a promising but challenging computer vision task, suffering from a lack of discriminative features that better aggregate both the spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a joint attentive spatial-temporal feature aggregation network (JAFN) for the video-based person Re-ID, simultaneously learning the quality- and frame-aware model to obtain attention-based spatial-temporal feature aggregation. Specifically, we utilize CNN to learn the spatial features, while introducing the LSTM to separately learn the temporal features. For the feature aggregation, we introduce two attention mechanisms respectively for generating the quality and frame significance score, where the quality score measures the quality of the images for attentive spatial feature aggregation, and the frame score measures the significance of the image frames contributing to the temporal feature. Then, we utilize the set-pooling for both the quality-aware spatial feature and the frame-aware temporal feature aggregation based on the attentive scores. The residual learning is also introduced to play between the LSTM and the CNN for adaptive spatial-temporal feature fusion. Furthermore, we adopt the data balance to alleviate the data disproportions existing in datasets of the video-based Re-ID. The extensive experimental results conducted on the PRID2011, i-LIDS-VID, and MARS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed JAFN. Furthermore, comparison results conducted on different modules and features in the JAFN show that our approach is of favorable generalization ability on attentively aggregating both the spatial and temporal features.},

  abstract = {To make deliberate progress towards more intelligent and more human-like artificial systems, we need to be following an appropriate feedback signal: we need to be able to define and evaluate intelligence in a way that enables comparisons between two systems, as well as comparisons with humans. Over the past hundred years, there has been an abundance of attempts to define and measure intelligence, across both the fields of psychology and AI. We summarize and critically assess these definitions and evaluation approaches, while making apparent the two historical conceptions of intelligence that have implicitly guided them. We note that in practice, the contemporary AI community still gravitates towards benchmarking intelligence by comparing the skill exhibited by AIs and humans at specific tasks such as board games and video games. We argue that solely measuring skill at any given task falls short of measuring intelligence, because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data allow experimenters to "buy" arbitrary levels of skills for a system, in a way that masks the system's own generalization power. We then articulate a new formal definition of intelligence based on Algorithmic Information Theory, describing intelligence as skill-acquisition efficiency and highlighting the concepts of scope, generalization difficulty, priors, and experience. Using this definition, we propose a set of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark should look like. Finally, we present a benchmark closely following these guidelines, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), built upon an explicit set of priors designed to be as close as possible to innate human priors. We argue that ARC can be used to measure a human-like form of general fluid intelligence and that it enables fair general intelligence comparisons between AI systems and humans.},

The paper underlines the importance of using domain knowledge by showing that under different settings, the better pseudo-predictor can lead properties of SSRL closer to those of ordinary supervised learning. Numerical experiments for low-dose computational tomography denoising and camera image denoising demonstrate that proposed SSRL significantly improves the denoising quality over several existing self-supervised denoising methods.},

  abstract = {The trustworthiness of neural networks is often challenged because they lack the ability to express uncertainty and explain their skill. This can be problematic given the increasing use of neural networks in high stakes decision-making such as in climate change applications. We address both issues by successfully implementing a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), where parameters are distributions rather than deterministic, and applying novel implementations of explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The uncertainty analysis from the BNN provides a comprehensive overview of the prediction more suited to practitioners' needs than predictions from a classical neural network. Using a BNN means we can calculate the entropy (i.e. uncertainty) of the predictions and determine if the probability of an outcome is statistically significant. To enhance trustworthiness, we also spatially apply the two XAI techniques of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values. These XAI methods reveal the extent to which the BNN is suitable and/or trustworthy. Using two techniques gives a more holistic view of BNN skill and its uncertainty, as LRP considers neural network parameters, whereas SHAP considers changes to outputs. We verify these techniques using comparison with intuition from physical theory. The differences in explanation identify potential areas where new physical theory guided studies are needed.},

Claims about the relationships between these six emotions and prototypical facial configurations have provided the basis for a long-standing debate over the diagnostic value of expression (for review and latest installment in this debate, see Barrett et al., p. 1). Building on recent empirical findings and methodologies, we offer an alternative conceptual and methodological approach that reveals a richer taxonomy of emotion. Dozens of distinct varieties of emotion are reliably distinguished by language, evoked in distinct circumstances, and perceived in distinct expressions of the face, body, and voice. Traditional models\textemdash both the basic six and affective-circumplex model (valence and arousal)\textemdash capture a fraction of the systematic variability in emotional response. In contrast, emotion-related responses (e.g., the smile of embarrassment, triumphant postures, sympathetic vocalizations, blends of distinct expressions) can be explained by richer models of emotion. Given these developments, we discuss why tests of a basic-six model of emotion are not tests of the diagnostic value of facial expression more generally. Determining the full extent of what facial expressions can tell us, marginally and in conjunction with other behavioral and contextual cues, will require mapping the high-dimensional, continuous space of facial, bodily, and vocal signals onto richly multifaceted experiences using large-scale statistical modeling and machine-learning methods.},

Concrete evidence linking social context to specific facial expressions is sparse and is largely based on survey-based approaches, which are often constrained by language and small sample sizes7\textendash 13. Here, by applying machine-learning methods to real-world, dynamic behaviour, we ascertain whether naturalistic social contexts (for example, weddings or sporting competitions) are associated with specific facial expressions14 across different cultures. In two experiments using deep neural networks, we examined the extent to which 16 types of facial expression occurred systematically in thousands of contexts in 6~million videos from 144 countries. We found that each kind of facial expression had distinct associations with a set of contexts that were 70\% preserved across 12~world regions. Consistent with these associations, regions varied in how frequently different facial expressions were produced as a function of which contexts were most salient. Our results reveal fine-grained patterns in human facial expressions that are preserved across the modern world.},

In this work, we show that while Transformers tend to have larger model capacity, their generalization can be worse than convolutional networks due to the lack of the right inductive bias. To effectively combine the strengths from both architectures, we present CoAtNets(pronounced "coat" nets), a family of hybrid models built from two key insights: (1) depthwise Convolution and self-Attention can be naturally unified via simple relative attention; (2) vertically stacking convolution layers and attention layers in a principled way is surprisingly effective in improving generalization, capacity and efficiency. Experiments show that our CoAtNets achieve state-of-the-art performance under different resource constraints across various datasets: Without extra data, CoAtNet achieves 86.0\% ImageNet top-1 accuracy; When pre-trained with 13M images from ImageNet-21K, our CoAtNet achieves 88.56\% top-1 accuracy, matching ViT-huge pre-trained with 300M images from JFT-300M while using 23x less data; Notably, when we further scale up CoAtNet with JFT-3B, it achieves 90.88\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, establishing a new state-of-the-art result.},

It is regarded as a potent tool of silent communication. Analysis of these expressions gives a significantly more profound insight into human behavior. AI-based Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has become one of the crucial research topics in recent years, with applications in dynamic analysis, pattern recognition, interpersonal interaction, mental health monitoring, and many more. However, with the global push towards online platforms due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a pressing need to innovate and offer a new FER analysis framework with the increasing visual data generated by videos and photographs.Furthermore, the emotion-wise facial expressions of kids, adults, and senior citizens vary, which must also be considered in the FER research. Lots of research work has been done in this area. However, it lacks a comprehensive overview of the literature that showcases the past work done and provides the aligned future directions. In this paper, the authors have provided a comprehensive evaluation of AI-based FER methodologies, including datasets, feature extraction techniques, algorithms, and the recent breakthroughs with their applications in facial expression identification. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the only review paper stating all aspects of FER for various age brackets and would significantly impact the research community in the coming years.},

In this paper, we first review the state-of-the-art of emotional and cognitive analysis for ADAS: we consider psychological models, the sensors needed for capturing physiological signals, and the typical algorithms used for human emotion classification. Our investigation highlights a lack of advanced Driver Monitoring Systems (DMSs) for ADASs, which could increase driving quality and security for both drivers and passengers. We then provide our view on a novel perception architecture for driver monitoring, built around the concept of Driver Complex State (DCS). DCS relies on multiple non-obtrusive sensors and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for uncovering the driver state and uses it to implement innovative Human-Machine Interface (HMI) functionalities. This concept will be implemented and validated in the recently EU-funded NextPerception project, which is briefly introduced.}

These biases have the tendency to propagate to the models that train on them, often leading to a poor performance in the minority class. In this project, we will explore the extent to which various data augmentation methods alleviate intrinsic biases within the dataset. We will apply several augmentation techniques on a sample of the UTKFace dataset, such as undersampling, geometric transformations, variational autoencoders (VAEs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs). We then trained a classifier for each of the augmented datasets and evaluated their performance on the native test set and on external facial recognition datasets. We have also compared their performance to the state-of-the-art attribute classifier trained on the FairFace dataset. Through experimentation, we were able to find that training the model on StarGAN-generated images led to the best overall performance. We also found that training on geometrically transformed images lead to a similar performance with a much quicker training time. Additionally, the best performing models also exhibit a uniform performance across the classes within each attribute. This signifies that the model was also able to mitigate the biases present in the baseline model that was trained on the original training set. Finally, we were able to show that our model has a better overall performance and consistency on age and ethnicity classification on multiple datasets when compared with the FairFace model. Our final model has an accuracy on the UTKFace test set of 91.75\%, 91.30\%, and 87.20\% for the gender, age, and ethnicity attribute respectively, with a standard deviation of less than 0.1 between the accuracies of the classes of each attribute.},

The theme of this study is to investigate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology on interaction design and how to use the interaction mode of AI technology to improve user experience. The research method of this paper is through the investigation of literature and face recognition experiments. The research results show that AI technology has a great impact on interaction design.

  abstract = {Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is presently the aspect of cognitive and affective computing with the most attention and popularity, aided by its vast application areas. Several studies have been conducted on FER, and many review works are also available. The existing FER review works only give an account of FER models capable of predicting the basic expressions. None of the works considers intensity estimation of an emotion; neither do they include studies that address data annotation inconsistencies and correlation among labels in their works. This work first introduces some identified FER application areas and provides a discussion on recognised FER challenges. We proceed to provide a comprehensive FER review in three different machine learning problem definitions: Single Label Learning (SLL)- which presents FER as a multiclass problem, Multilabel Learning (MLL)- that resolves the ambiguity nature of FER, and Label Distribution Learning- that recovers the distribution of emotion in FER data annotation. We also include studies on expression intensity estimation from the face. Furthermore, popularly employed FER models are thoroughly and carefully discussed in handcrafted, conventional machine learning and deep learning models. We finally itemise some recognise unresolved issues and also suggest future research areas in the field.},

Accuracy was higher when emotions were both expressed and recognized by members of the same national, ethnic, or regional group, suggesting an in-group advantage. This advantage was smaller for cultural groups with greater exposure to one another, measured in terms of living in the same nation, physical proximity, and telephone communication. Majority group members were poorer at judging minority group members than the reverse. Cross-cultural accuracy was lower in studies that used a balanced research design, and higher in studies that used imitation rather than posed or spontaneous emotional expressions. Attributes of study design appeared not to moderate the size of the in-group advantage. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

We expand the analysis to present three tests based on mathematical, semantic (that is, the Turing Test), and ethical questions and show that GPT-3 is not designed to pass any of them. This is a reminder that GPT-3 does not do what it is not supposed to do, and that any interpretation of GPT-3 as the beginning of the emergence of a general form of artificial intelligence is merely uninformed science fiction.

  abstract = {A structured organization of information is typically required by symbolic processing. On the other hand, most connectionist models assume that data are organized according to relatively poor structures, like arrays or sequences. The framework described in this paper is an attempt to unify adaptive models like artificial neural nets and belief nets for the problem of processing structured information. In particular, relations between data variables are expressed by directed acyclic graphs, where both numerical and categorical values coexist. The general framework proposed in this paper can be regarded as an extension of both recurrent neural networks and hidden Markov models to the case of acyclic graphs. In particular we study the supervised learning problem as the problem of learning transductions from an input structured space to an output structured space, where transductions are assumed to admit a recursive hidden state-space representation. We introduce a graphical formalism for representing this class of adaptive transductions by means of recursive networks, i.e., cyclic graphs where nodes are labeled by variables and edges are labeled by generalized delay elements. This representation makes it possible to incorporate the symbolic and subsymbolic nature of data. Structures are processed by unfolding the recursive network into an acyclic graph called encoding network. In so doing, inference and learning algorithms can be easily inherited from the corresponding algorithms for artificial neural networks or probabilistic graphical model.},

  abstract = {Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match cross-modality pedestrian images, breaking through the limitation of single-modality person ReID in dark environment. In order to mitigate the impact of large modality discrepancy, existing works manually design various two-stream architectures to separately learn modality-specific and modality-sharable representations. Such a manual design routine, however, highly depends on massive experiments and empirical practice, which is time consuming and labor intensive. In this paper, we systematically study the manually designed architectures, and identify that appropriately separating Batch Normalization (BN) layers is the key to bring a great boost towards cross-modality matching. Based on this observation, the essential objective is to find the optimal separation scheme for each BN layer. To this end, we propose a novel method, named Cross-Modality Neural Architecture Search (CM-NAS). It consists of a BN-oriented search space in which the standard optimization can be fulfilled subject to the cross-modality task. Equipped with the searched architecture, our method outperforms state-of-the-art counter-parts in both two benchmarks, improving the Rank-1/mAP by 6.70\%/6.13\% on SYSU-MM01 and by 12.17\%/11.23\% on RegDB.

  abstract = {Visual SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) refers to the problem of using images, as the only source of external information, in order to establish the position of a robot, a vehicle, or a moving camera in an environment, and at the same time, construct a representation of the explored zone. SLAM is an essential task for the autonomy of a robot. Nowadays, the problem of SLAM is considered solved when range sensors such as lasers or sonar are used to built 2D maps of small static environments. However SLAM for dynamic, complex and large scale environments, using vision as the sole external sensor, is an active area of research. The computer vision techniques employed in visual SLAM, such as detection, description and matching of salient features, image recognition and retrieval, among others, are still susceptible of improvement. The objective of this article is to provide new researchers in the field of visual SLAM a brief and comprehensible review of the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract = {Fairness-aware learning aims at satisfying various fairness constraints in addition to the usual performance criteria via data-driven machine learning techniques. Most of the research in fairness-aware learning employs the setting of fair-supervised learning. However, many dynamic real-world applications can be better modeled using sequential decision-making problems and fair reinforcement learning provides a more suitable alternative for addressing these problems. In this article, we provide an extensive overview of fairness approaches that have been implemented via a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. We discuss various practical applications in which RL methods have been applied to achieve a fair solution with high accuracy. We further include various facets of the theory of fair reinforcement learning, organizing them into single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, long-term fairness via RL, and offline learning. Moreover, we highlight a few major issues to explore in order to advance the field of fair-RL, namely - i) correcting societal biases, ii) feasibility of group fairness or individual fairness, and iii) explainability in RL. Our work is beneficial for both researchers and practitioners as we discuss articles providing mathematical guarantees as well as articles with empirical studies on real-world problems.},

To this end, the factors relevant to the transmission of affective states have been studied and included in an ontology.

Finally, an interactive multimodal system was created to validate the proposed ontology-based platform and to apply the study to real-life cases.},

This foundational element originated from the combination of mathematics and Claude Shannon's Theory of Information. Coupled with the 50-year legacy of Moore's Law, the bit has propelled the digitization of our world. In recent years, artificial intelligence systems, merging neuron-inspired biology with information, have achieved superhuman accuracy in a range of narrow classification tasks by learning from labelled data. Advancing from Narrow AI to Broad AI will encompass the unification of learning and reasoning through neuro-symbolic systems, resulting in a form of AI which will perform multiple tasks, operate across multiple domains, and learn from small quantities of multi-modal input data. Finally, the union of physics and information led to the emergence of Quantum Information Theory and the development of the quantum bit - the qubit - forming the basis of quantum computers. We have built the first programmable quantum computers, and although the technology is still in its early days, these systems offer the potential to solve problems which even the most powerful classical computers cannot. The future of computing will look fundamentally different than it has in the past. It will not be based on more and cheaper bits alone, but rather, it will be built upon bits + neurons + qubits. This future will enable the next generation of intelligent mission-critical systems and accelerate the rate of science-driven discovery.},

This paper describes a low-power technique for the object re-identification (reID) problem: matching a query image against a gallery of previously seen images. State-of-the-art techniques rely on large, computationally-intensive Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We propose a novel hierarchical DNN architecture that uses attribute labels in the training dataset to perform efficient object reID. At each node in the hierarchy, a small DNN identifies a different attribute of the query image. The small DNN at each leaf node is specialized to re-identify a subset of the gallery: only the images with the attributes identified along the path from the root to a leaf. Thus, a query image is re-identified accurately after processing with a few small DNNs. We compare our method with state-of-the-art object reID techniques. With a 4\% loss in accuracy, our approach realizes significant resource savings: 74\% less memory, 72\% fewer operations, and 67\% lower query latency, yielding 65\% less energy consumption.},

However, the models in the literature are not able to deal with structured organization of information, that is typically required by symbolic processing. In many application domains, the patterns are not only structured, but a fuzziness degree is attached to each subsymbolic pattern primitive. The purpose of this paper is to show how recursive neural networks, properly conceived for dealing with structured information, can represent nondeterministic fuzzy frontier-to-root tree automata. Whereas available prior knowledge expressed in terms of fuzzy state transition rules are injected into a recursive network, unknown rules are supposed to be filled in by data-driven learning. We also prove the stability of the encoding algorithm, extending previous results on the injection of fuzzy finite-state dynamics in high-order recurrent networks.},

  abstract = {The core problem of visual multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (MR-SLAM) is how to efficiently and accurately perform multi-robot global localization (MR-GL). The difficulties are two-fold. The first is the difficulty of global localization for significant viewpoint difference. Appearance-based localization methods tend to fail under large viewpoint changes. Recently, semantic graphs have been utilized to overcome the viewpoint variation problem. However, the methods are highly time-consuming, especially in large-scale environments. This leads to the second difficulty, which is how to perform real-time global localization. In this letter, we propose a semantic histogram based graph matching method that is robust to viewpoint variation and can achieve real-time global localization. Based on that, we develop a system that can accurately and efficiently perform MR-GL for both homogeneous and heterogeneous robots. The experimental results show that our approach is about 30 times faster than Random Walk based semantic descriptors. Moreover, it achieves an accuracy of 95\% for global localization, while the accuracy of the state-of-the-art method is 85\%.},

Little attention has been given to the use of domain knowledge. Ontology plays an important role in learning to categorize images into abstract classes where there may not be a clear visual connect between category and image, for example identifying image mood - happy, sad and neutral. Our algorithm combines CNN and ontology priors to infer abstract patterns in Indian Monument Images. We use a transfer learning based approach in which, knowledge of domain is transferred to CNN while training (top down transfer) and inference is made using CNN prediction and ontology tree/priors (bottom up transfer ). We classify images to categories like Tomb, Fort and Mosque. We demonstrate that our method improves remarkably over logistic classifier and other transfer learning approach.

  abstract = {The involvement of technology in medical health has already been a great success to a large extent; it is used to measure depression and initiate the advancement into the field of mental health toward therapy and counselling. According to the WHO, good health is not only about zero sicknesses or disability but is also about physical well-being, sound mental state and social and spiritual welfare. The technological implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in mental health has vast potential for personalizing treatment selection, prognostication, and relapse monitoring. Moreover, it provides remedies to reduce stress and anxiety for situations that do not require immediate and necessary medical intrusion and emergency contacts and services in case of a severe condition. Particularly, to discern depressive behaviours, multi-modal data is used to examine and exploit a large variety of parameters. Unlike the usual method of having an observational study that is done by taking surveys or questionnaires, the AI model helps us to understand and explore the inconspicuous and reliable detection of depressive symptoms obtained from visual and vocal features of the user. In today's time, vocalizing one's concerns regarding their mental health must be normalized. As humans, it is normal to feel different emotions at once. The application is free and anonymous to make the users feel empowered and safe in seeking treatment. Mental health is all about how an individual thinks, feels and copes up with events in their life.},

This abstract view does not suffice for the decision making capabilities required by robotic agents that are to accomplish manipulation tasks. Such robots have to reason about how to pour without spilling, where to grasp a pot, how to open different containers, and so on. To enable such reasoning it is necessary to consider how objects are perceived, how motions can be executed and parameterized, and how motion parameterization affects the physical effects of actions. To this end, we propose to complement and extend symbolic reasoning methods with KnowRobSIM, an additional reasoning infrastructure based on modern game engine technology, including the subsymbolic world modeling through data structures, action simulation based on physics engine, and world scene rendering. We demonstrate how KnowRobSIM can perform powerful reasoning, prediction, and learning tasks that are required for informed decision making in object manipulation.},

  abstract = {Advocates for Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy) assert that combining deep learning with symbolic reasoning will lead to stronger AI than either paradigm on its own. As successful as deep learning has been, it is generally accepted that even our best deep learning systems are not very good at abstract reasoning. And since reasoning is inextricably linked to language, it makes intuitive sense that Natural Language Processing (NLP), would be a particularly well-suited candidate for NeSy. We conduct a structured review of studies implementing NeSy for NLP, challenges and future directions, and aim to answer the question of whether NeSy is indeed meeting its promises: reasoning, out-of-distribution generalization, interpretability, learning and reasoning from small data, and transferability to new domains. We examine the impact of knowledge representation, such as rules and semantic networks, language structure and relational structure, and whether implicit or explicit reasoning contributes to higher promise scores. We find that knowledge encoded in relational structures and explicit reasoning tend to lead to more NeSy goals being satisfied. We also advocate for a more methodical approach to the application of theories of reasoning, which we hope can reduce some of the friction between the symbolic and sub-symbolic schools of AI.},

  abstract = {Facial expression is widely used to evaluate emotional impairment in neuropsychiatric disorders. Ekman and Friesen's Facial Action Coding System (FACS) encodes movements of individual facial muscles from distinct momentary changes in facial appearance. Unlike facial expression ratings based on categorization of expressions into prototypical emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, etc.), FACS can encode ambiguous and subtle expressions, and therefore is potentially more suitable for analyzing the small differences in facial affect. However, FACS rating requires extensive training, and is time consuming and subjective thus prone to bias. To overcome these limitations, we developed an automated FACS based on advanced computer science technology. The system automatically tracks faces in a video, extracts geometric and texture features, and produces temporal profiles of each facial muscle movement. These profiles are quantified to compute frequencies of single and combined Action Units (AUs) in videos, and they can facilitate a statistical study of large populations in disorders known to impact facial expression. We derived quantitative measures of flat and inappropriate facial affect automatically from temporal AU profiles. Applicability of the automated FACS was illustrated in a pilot study, by applying it to data of videos from eight schizophrenia patients and controls. We created temporal AU profiles that provided rich information on the dynamics of facial muscle movements for each subject. The quantitative measures of flatness and inappropriateness showed clear differences between patients and the controls, highlighting their potential in automatic and objective quantification of symptom severity.},

The accurate detection of facial landmarks improves the localization of the salient patches on face images. This paper proposes a novel framework for expression recognition by using appearance features of selected facial patches. A few prominent facial patches, depending on the position of facial landmarks, are extracted which are active during emotion elicitation. These active patches are further processed to obtain the salient patches which contain discriminative features for classification of each pair of expressions, thereby selecting different facial patches as salient for different pair of expression classes. One-against-one classification method is adopted using these features. In addition, an automated learning-free facial landmark detection technique has been proposed, which achieves similar performances as that of other state-of-art landmark detection methods, yet requires significantly less execution time. The proposed method is found to perform well consistently in different resolutions, hence, providing a solution for expression recognition in low resolution images. Experiments on CK+ and JAFFE facial expression databases show the effectiveness of the proposed system.},

In this paper, we propose a novel OM system named BERTMap which can support both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. It first predicts mappings using a classifier based on fine-tuning the contextual embedding model BERT on text semantics corpora extracted from ontologies, and then refines the mappings through extension and repair by utilizing the ontology structure and logic. Our evaluation with three alignment tasks on biomedical ontologies demonstrates that BERTMap can often perform better than the leading OM systems LogMap and AML.},

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8\texttimes{} deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

DenseIL contains a CNN encoder and a Dense Interaction (DI) decoder. The CNN encoder is responsible for efficiently extracting discriminative spatial features while the DI decoder is designed to densely model spatial-temporal inherent interaction across frames. Different from previous works, we additionally let the DI decoder densely attends to intermediate fine-grained CNN features and that naturally yields multi-grained spatial-temporal representation for each video clip. Moreover, we introduce Spatio-TEmporal Positional Embedding (STEP-Emb) into the DI decoder to investigate the positional relation among the spatial-temporal inputs. Our experiments consistently and significantly outperform all the state-of-the-art methods on multiple standard video-based person re-ID datasets.},

Meanwhile deep learning approaches even exceed human performance in particular tasks. However, such approaches have some disadvantages besides of needing big quality data, much computational power and engineering effort; those approaches are becoming increasingly opaque, and even if we understand the underlying mathematical principles of such models they still lack explicit declarative knowledge. For example, words are mapped to high-dimensional vectors, making them unintelligible to humans. What we need in the future are context-adaptive procedures, i.e. systems that construct contextual explanatory models for classes of real-world phenomena. This is the goal of explainable AI, which is not a new field; rather, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself. While rule-based approaches of early AI were comprehensible ``glass-box'' approaches at least in narrow domains, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Maybe one step further is in linking probabilistic learning methods with large knowledge representations (ontologies) and logical approaches, thus making results re-traceable, explainable and comprehensible on demand.},

Detail Branch processes frames at original resolution to preserve the detailed visual clues, and Context Branch with a down-sampling strategy is employed to capture long-range contexts. On each branch, BiCnet appends multiple parallel and diverse attention modules to discover divergent body parts for consecutive frames, so as to obtain an integral characteristic of target identity. Furthermore, a Temporal Kernel Selection (TKS) block is designed to capture short-term as well as long-term temporal relations by an adaptive mode. TKS can be inserted into BiCnet at any depth to construct BiCnetTKS for spatial-temporal modeling. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show that BiCnet-TKS outperforms state-of-the-arts with about 50\% less computations.

It plays an essential role in various applications such as autonomous driving, 3D reconstruction, augmented reality, and robot navigation. Recent successes on the task have been demonstrated and dominated by deep learning based solutions. In this article, for the first time, we provide a comprehensive literature review that helps readers better grasp the research trends and clearly understand the current advances. We investigate the related studies from the design aspects of network architectures, loss functions, benchmark datasets, and learning strategies with a proposal of a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing methods. Besides, we present a quantitative comparison of model performance on two widely used benchmark datasets, including an indoor and an outdoor dataset. Finally, we discuss the challenges of prior works and provide readers with some insights for future research directions.},

In order to boost the representational power of a network, several recent approaches have shown the benefit of enhancing spatial encoding. In this work, we focus on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the "Squeeze-and-Excitation" (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We demonstrate that by stacking these blocks together, we can construct SENet architectures that generalise extremely well across challenging datasets. Crucially, we find that SE blocks produce significant performance improvements for existing state-of-the-art deep architectures at minimal additional computational cost. SENets formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and significantly reduced the top-5 error to 2.251\%, achieving a 25\% relative improvement over the winning entry of 2016.

We accomplished a categorization precision of 58.6\% for six types of emotions (bliss, anguish, curiosity, despair, fury, hatred) and mean efficiency of 96.8\% for two emotions (bliss and curiosity).The current study utilizes interest points as markers in face images that are damaged by few emotions as well as correlates its location to that of a normal expression. The outputs are viewed in contrast with Paul Ekman's FACS (Facial Action Coding System) tool to check on the efficacy of the algorithm .The automated identification of face expressions utilizing image template matching method faces various issues pertaining to facial features and recording circumstances. Although this field has reached great heights , choosing of features as well as categorization method for emotion identification , till today remains an unsolved mystery. To suppress feature outliers, the proposed technique comprises of pixel normalization which is used to eliminate intensity offsets backed up using a Min-Max metric in a nearest neighbor classifier. The proposed Min-Max classification technique has an efficiency of 92.85\% to 98.57\% when checked on JAFFE database. Classification task also done using KNN, SVM and Bagged Tree Classifier.},

  abstract = {At initialization, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are equivalent to Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit, thus connecting them to kernel methods. We prove that the evolution of an ANN during training can also be described by a kernel: during gradient descent on the parameters of an ANN, the network function \$f\_\textbackslash theta\$ (which maps input vectors to output vectors) follows the kernel gradient of the functional cost (which is convex, in contrast to the parameter cost) w.r.t. a new kernel: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This kernel is central to describe the generalization features of ANNs. While the NTK is random at initialization and varies during training, in the infinite-width limit it converges to an explicit limiting kernel and it stays constant during training. This makes it possible to study the training of ANNs in function space instead of parameter space. Convergence of the training can then be related to the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK. We prove the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK when the data is supported on the sphere and the non-linearity is non-polynomial. We then focus on the setting of least-squares regression and show that in the infinite-width limit, the network function \$f\_\textbackslash theta\$ follows a linear differential equation during training. The convergence is fastest along the largest kernel principal components of the input data with respect to the NTK, hence suggesting a theoretical motivation for early stopping. Finally we study the NTK numerically, observe its behavior for wide networks, and compare it to the infinite-width limit.},

  abstract = {Automatic face expression recognition is an exigent research subject and a challenge in computer vision. It is an interdisciplinary domain standing at the crossing of behavioural science, psychology, neurology, and artificial intelligence. Human-robot interaction is getting more significant with the automation of every field, like treating autistic patients, child therapy, babysitting, etc. In all the cases robots need to understand the present state of mind for better decision making. It is difficult for machine learning techniques to recognize the expressions of people since there will be significant changes in the way of their expressions. The emotions expressed through the human face have its importance in making arguments and decisions on different subjects. Machine Learning with Computer Vision and Deep Learning can be used to recognize facial expressions from the preloaded or real time images with human faces. DNN (Deep Neural Networking) is one among the hottest areas of research and is found to be very effective in classification of images with a high degree of accuracy. In the proposed work, the popular dataset CK+ is analysed for comparison. The dataset FER 2013 and home-brewed data sets are used in the work for calculating the accuracy of the model created. The results are obtained in such a way that DCNN approach is very efficient in facial emotion recognition. Experiments and study show that the dataset, FER 2013 is a high-quality dataset with equal efficiency as the other two popular datasets. This paper aims to ameliorate the accuracy of classification of facial emotion.},

The traditional methodologies are proving to be inefficient in such an environment for teaching as well as managerial tasks. Also considering their cumbersome nature, the need for a newer, stronger, and better model is evident. As of now, many Deep Learning techniques have been employed for the purpose, ranging from the usage of standard object detection APIs or even CNNs and their variants. Our study proposes a model based on SVM embedded on top of embedding vectors combined with a Single-shot detector for real-time monitoring of attendance and attentiveness of students in a virtual classroom set up making use of video feed. A small comparative study between the proposed model and dlib, a standard library for the purpose as well is performed. The results show that our model outperforms dlib methodology significantly with high accuracy and performance efficiency. We had done experimentations on the fer2013 dataset particularly for emotion detection and custom datasets in general. Even though the model performs well in our experimentations, the need for a stronger and better dataset is high for evaluating the model and implementing it in real-life scenarios.},

The physiologists who, during the past few years, have been so industriously exploring the functions of the brain, have limited their attempts at explanation to its cognitive and volitional performances. Dividing the brain into sensorial and motor centres, they have found their division to be exactly paralleled by the analysis made by empirical psychology, of the perceptive and volitional parts of the mind into their simplest elements. But the aesthetic sphere of the mind, its longings, its pleasures and pains, and its emotions, have been ignored in all these researches. And yet it is even now certain that of two things concerning the emotions, one must be true. Either separate and special centres, affected to them alone, are their brain-seat, or else they correspond to processes occurring in the motor and sensory centres, already assigned, or in others like them, not yet mapped out. If the former be the case we must deny the current view, and hold the cortex to be something more than the surface of projection for every sensitive spot and every muscle in the body. If the latter be the case, we must ask whether the emotional process in the sensory or motor centre be an altogether peculiar one, or whether it resembles the ordinary perceptive processes of which those centres are already recognised to be the seat. The purpose of the following pages is to show that the last alternative comes nearest to the truth, and that the emotional brain-processes not only resemble the ordinary sensorial brain-processes, but in very truth, are nothing but such processes variously combined.

Existing methods often rely on estimated pseudo labels via iterative clustering and classification, and they are unfortunately highly susceptible to performance penalties incurred by the inaccurate estimated number of clusters. Alternatively, we propose the Meta Pairwise Relationship Distillation (MPRD) method to estimate the pseudo labels of sample pairs for unsupervised person Re-ID. Specifically, it consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), in which the GCN estimates the pseudo labels of sample pairs based on the current features extracted by CNN, and the CNN learns better features by involving high-fidelity positive and negative sample pairs imposed by GCN. To achieve this goal, a small amount of labeled samples are used to guide GCN training, which can distill meta knowledge to judge the difference in the neighborhood structure between positive and negative sample pairs. Extensive experiments on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17 datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.},

While alternatives such as neuro-symbolic approaches have been proposed, there is a lack of consensus on what they are about. There are often two independent motivations (i) symbols as a lingua franca for human-AI interaction and (ii) symbols as system-produced abstractions used by the AI system in its internal reasoning. The jury is still out on whether AI systems will need to use symbols in their internal reasoning to achieve general intelligence capabilities. Whatever the answer there is, the need for (human-understandable) symbols in human-AI interaction seems quite compelling. Symbols, like emotions, may well not be sine qua non for intelligence per se, but they will be crucial for AI systems to interact with us humans -- as we can neither turn off our emotions nor get by without our symbols. In particular, in many human-designed domains, humans would be interested in providing explicit (symbolic) knowledge and advice -- and expect machine explanations in kind. This alone requires AI systems to to maintain a symbolic interface for interaction with humans. In this blue sky paper, we argue this point of view, and discuss research directions that need to be pursued to allow for this type of human-AI interaction.},

  abstract = {Supervised deep learning methods require a large repository of annotated data; hence, label noise is inevitable. Training with such noisy data negatively impacts the generalization performance of deep neural networks. To combat label noise, recent state-of-the-art methods employ some sort of sample selection mechanism to select a possibly clean subset of data. Next, an off-the-shelf semi-supervised learning method is used for training where rejected samples are treated as unlabeled data. Our comprehensive analysis shows that current selection methods disproportionately select samples from easy (fast learnable) classes while rejecting those from relatively harder ones. This creates class imbalance in the selected clean set and in turn, deteriorates performance under high label noise. In this work, we propose UNICON, a simple yet effective sample selection method which is robust to high label noise. To address the disproportionate selection of easy and hard samples, we introduce a Jensen-Shannon divergence based uniform selection mechanism which does not require any probabilistic modeling and hyperparameter tuning. We complement our selection method with contrastive learning to further combat the memorization of noisy labels. Extensive experimentation on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of UNICON; we obtain an 11.4\% improvement over the current state-of-the-art on CIFAR100 dataset with a 90\% noise rate. Our code is publicly available},

Although an essential element of modern AI, LMs are also inherently limited in a number of ways. We discuss these limitations and how they can be avoided by adopting a systems approach. Conceptualizing the challenge as one that involves knowledge and reasoning in addition to linguistic processing, we define a flexible architecture with multiple neural models, complemented by discrete knowledge and reasoning modules. We describe this neuro-symbolic architecture, dubbed the Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language (MRKL, pronounced "miracle") system, some of the technical challenges in implementing it, and Jurassic-X, AI21 Labs' MRKL system implementation.},

Where the use of technology helps to curb various mental illnesses like anxiety, depression, schizophrenia etc. So, there is a need to create efficient artificial intelligent devices. In this experimental project, we developed a multimodal system using neural networks (CNN) for recognizing emotions from facial expressions and voice. We used an RGB images dataset for facial expression recognition. For voice emotion recognition, an audio recorded files dataset was used. We presented phases of automatic emotion recognition in the form of data acquisition, data analysis and data visualization. Comparative analysis among recent papers, features affecting the performance and proposed model in terms of accuracy have also been given in tabular form. The proposed model shows accuracy of 73\% and 90.91\% for face and voice features respectively. It's observed that variations in the factors of the feature-training phase of neural networks like epochs, batch sizes, training datasets, also affect the results.},

  abstract = {A cognitive agent should have the capability to learn autonomously in completely unforeseen situations. "Unforeseen" means something that was not taken into account in an internal representation of the world. However, it is detectable in the form of anomalous sensor measurements. Two problems must be solved: 1) the "newness" of the situation must be detected, i.e. it should not be allocated (wrongly) to an existing category; and 2) new concepts must be learned so that when a similar situation occurs again it is no longer anomalous. A conceptual framework is presented here based on a form of symbol grounding which emphasises a continual distinction between model-driven expectancy and actual reality. Large differences between expectation and reality indicate that a new concept is required which corresponds more accurately to the sensor data. This results in the autonomous growth and change of symbol groundings. Genetic programming is considered as a tool (both on the symbolic and the subsymbolic levels).},

To solve this issue, in this paper we propose to use a MobileNetV2-based transfer learning approach to investigate how knowledge may be gathered inside a specific dataset and how information from ImageNet dataset (14,197,122 images) can be transferred into Kaggle emotion dataset (36082 images) to improve overall performance. To test the reliability of our system, we ran a series of tests using Kaggle emotion datasets containing seven different emotions. The experimental findings show that our emotion recognition system (ERS) system, which obtained 98.70\% accuracy at a learning rate of 0.0001, leads to enhanced emotion detection performance and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods that use fine-tuning and pre-trained techniques.},

  abstract = {This article aims to study intrusion attacks and then develop a novel cyberattack detection framework for blockchain networks. Specifically, we first design and implement a blockchain network in our laboratory. This blockchain network will serve two purposes, i.e., generate the real traffic data (including both normal data and attack data) for our learning models and implement real-time experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed intrusion detection framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset that is synthesized in a laboratory for cyberattacks in a blockchain network. We then propose a novel collaborative learning model that allows efficient deployment in the blockchain network to detect attacks. The main idea of the proposed learning model is to enable blockchain nodes to actively collect data, share the knowledge learned from its data, and then exchange the knowledge with other blockchain nodes in the network. In this way, we can not only leverage the knowledge from all the nodes in the network but also do not need to gather all raw data for training at a centralized node like conventional centralized learning solutions. Such a framework can also avoid the risk of exposing local data's privacy as well as the excessive network overhead/congestion. Both intensive simulations and real-time experiments clearly show that our proposed collaborative learning-based intrusion detection framework can achieve an accuracy of up to 97.7\% in detecting attacks.},

It is a part of machine learning, which in turns a part of artificial intelligence, and it consists of networks that are capable of learning from unsupervised, unstructured, or unlabeled data. When the size of the input data is vast, deep learning can outperform machine learning. Despite traditional programs, which develop insights with data in a linear fashion, deep learning systems include a hierarchical characteristic which permits machines to analyze the data in a non-linear fashion. Deep learning is advised for complicated tasks involving massive quantities of data, such as picture classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition In the scientific world, facial expression recognition is a passionately disputed issue. Human express their feelings using facial expressions. Humans can easily distinguish facial expressions, but computers find it challenging to do so because human facial expressions might fluctuate in photos due to elements such as brightness, contrast, and so on. This research uses seven main human emotions to train computers. Sadness, contempt, fear, happiness, anger, surprise, and neutral are among the emotions. Convolutional Neural Networks have the potential to solve among the most popular complex challenges in the fields such as deep learning and computer vision: facial emotion recognition. The system is being developed in three stages: image pre-processing, detection, and classification. Every iteration, the accuracy will be enhanced by fine-tuning key parameters for example, the initial thick layer's unit count, the rate of dropout in the dropout layer, as well as optimization strategies. Various optimizers, including as Adam, Adagrad, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Nadam, were utilized to achieve the best accuracy.},

  abstract = {Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods such as masked language modeling have shown massive performance gains by pretraining transformer models for a variety of natural language processing tasks. The follow-up research adapted similar methods like masked image modeling in vision transformer and demonstrated improvements in the image classification task. Such simple self-supervised methods are not exhaustively studied for object detection transformers (DETR, Deformable DETR) as their transformer encoder modules take input in the convolutional neural network (CNN) extracted feature space rather than the image space as in general vision transformers. However, the CNN feature maps still maintain the spatial relationship and we utilize this property to design self-supervised learning approaches to train the encoder of object detection transformers in pretraining and multi-task learning settings. We explore common self-supervised methods based on image reconstruction, masked image modeling and jigsaw. Preliminary experiments in the iSAID dataset demonstrate faster convergence of DETR in the initial epochs in both pretraining and multi-task learning settings; nonetheless, similar improvement is not observed in the case of multi-task learning with Deformable DETR. The code for our experiments with DETR and Deformable DETR are available at https://github.com/gokulkarthik/detr and https://github.com/gokulkarthik/Deformable-DETR respectively.},

  abstract = {Navigation systems help users access unfamiliar environments. Current technological advancements enable users to encapsulate these systems in handheld devices, which effectively increases the popularity of navigation systems and the number of users. In indoor environments, lack of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals and line of sight with orbiting satellites makes navigation more challenging compared to outdoor environments. Radio frequency (RF) signals, computer vision, and sensor-based solutions are more suitable for tracking the users in indoor environments. This article provides a comprehensive summary of evolution in indoor navigation and indoor positioning technologies. In particular, the paper reviews different computer vision-based indoor navigation and positioning systems along with indoor scene recognition methods that can aid the indoor navigation. Navigation and positioning systems that utilize pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) methods and various communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) visible light, Bluetooth and ultra-wide band (UWB), are detailed as well. Moreover, this article investigates and contrasts the different navigation systems in each category. Various evaluation criteria for indoor navigation systems are proposed in this work. The article concludes with a brief insight into future directions in indoor positioning and navigation systems.},

Different from existing approaches, our algorithm considers contextual correlation among words, described in domain knowledge ontologies, to generate semantic explanations. To narrow down the search space for explanations, which is a major problem of long and complicated text data, we design a learnable anchor algorithm, to better extract explanations locally. A set of regulations is further introduced, regarding combining learned interpretable representations with anchors to generate comprehensible semantic explanations. An extensive experiment conducted on two real-world datasets shows that our approach generates more precise and insightful explanations compared with baseline approaches.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

Therefore, growing attention has been paid to automatic depression assessment, especially from speech. However, most of the previous work uses hand-crafted features or deep neural network-based feature extractors to obtain deep features and then feed them into a classifier or a regression, which ignores the temporal relation of these features. To address this issue, this paper proposes a global information embedding (GIE) to make use of the long-term global information of depression and re-weight the LSTM output sequence. The short-term features are then pooled into long-term features by LASSO optimization to further improve the accuracy of depression recognition. Experiments on AVEC 2013 and AVEC 2014 verified the proposed method, and the RMSEs are 9.63 and 9.40, respectively.},

We propose an identity and emotion joint learning approach with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance the performance of facial expression recognition (FER) tasks. First, we learn the emotion and identity features separately using two different CNNs with their corresponding training data. Second, we concatenate these two features together as a deep-learned Tandem Facial Expression (TFE) Feature and feed it to the subsequent fully connected layers to form a new model. Finally, we perform joint learning on the newly merged network using only the facial expression training data. Experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves 99.31 and 84.29 percent accuracy on the CK+ and the FER+ database, respectively, which outperforms the residual network baseline as well as many other state-of-the-art methods.},

In this paper, a graph-based multi-task self-supervised learning model (GMSS) for EEG emotion recognition is proposed. GMSS has the ability to learn more general representations by integrating multiple self-supervised tasks, including spatial and frequency jigsaw puzzle tasks, and contrastive learning tasks. By learning from multiple tasks simultaneously, GMSS can find a representation that captures all of the tasks thereby decreasing the chance of overfitting on the original task, i.e., emotion recognition task. In particular, the spatial jigsaw puzzle task aims to capture the intrinsic spatial relationships of different brain regions. Considering the importance of frequency information in EEG emotional signals, the goal of the frequency jigsaw puzzle task is to explore the crucial frequency bands for EEG emotion recognition. To further regularize the learned features and encourage the network to learn inherent representations, contrastive learning task is adopted in this work by mapping the transformed data into a common feature space. Experiments on SEED, SEED-IV, and MPED datasets show that the proposed model has remarkable advantages in learning more discriminative and general features for EEG emotional signals.},

Due to the effects of multipath propagation, wireless-based indoor localization methods such as WiFi, bluetooth, and pseudolite have difficulty achieving high precision position. In this work, we present an image-based localization approach which can get the position just by taking a picture of the surrounding environment. This paper proposes a novel approach which classifies different scenes based on deep belief networks and solves the camera position with several spatial reference points extracted from depth images by the perspective--point algorithm. To evaluate the performance, experiments are conducted on public data and real scenes; the result demonstrates that our approach can achieve submeter positioning accuracy. Compared with other methods, image-based indoor localization methods do not require infrastructure and have a wide range of applications that include self-driving, robot navigation, and augmented reality.},

At present, most of the methods to solve the problem of multi-label emotion recognition focus on analyzing the semantics of the text, ignoring the semantic information brought by emotion tags, and not modeling the semantic relationship between emotion labels and text. In this paper, a method of multi-label emotion recognition based on label similarity attention mechanism is proposed. In this method, bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is used to obtain the context knowledge of the text, so as to achieve the purpose of learning the global information of the text. The label features are learned by the label encoder. The label similarity attention mechanism is used to obtain the correlation matrix between the label and the word representation, and further strengthen the semantic information. At the same time, CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) is used to obtain local semantic information. The semantic representation of sentences is enriched. Finally, emotion recognition is carried out through the classifier. In the classifier, this paper proposes a joint loss function, which enables the model to learn the emotional characteristics of texts and labels at the same time. The model combines the global and local information of the text to show the semantic relationship between the text and the emotional label. The experimental results on the NLPCC2014Task1 dataset show that the proposed model has a certain performance improvement compared with the benchmark method.},

We'll be concentrating on implicit emotion recognition, which is a challenging problem to tackle because emotion is hidden inside the text and solving it necessitates identifying the text's context. The resulting intelligent system will display emotions extracted from the text, which will be divided into five categories: joy, sadness, fear, rage, and neutral. The accuracy of the model was 91.72 percent, which is much higher than that of typical machine learning and neural network approaches.},

  abstract = {Past research on facial expressions have used relatively limited datasets, which makes it unclear whether current methods can be employed in real world. In this paper, we present a novel database, RAF-DB, which contains about 30000 facial images from thousands of individuals. Each image has been individually labeled about 40 times, then EM algorithm was used to filter out unreliable labels. Crowdsourcing reveals that real-world faces often express compound emotions, or even mixture ones. For all we know, RAF-DB is the first database that contains compound expressions in the wild. Our cross-database study shows that the action units of basic emotions in RAF-DB are much more diverse than, or even deviate from, those of labcontrolled ones. To address this problem, we propose a new DLP-CNN (Deep Locality-Preserving CNN) method, which aims to enhance the discriminative power of deep features by preserving the locality closeness while maximizing the inter-class scatters. The benchmark experiments on the 7class basic expressions and 11-class compound expressions, as well as the additional experiments on SFEW and CK+ databases, show that the proposed DLP-CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art handcrafted features and deep learning based methods for the expression recognition in the wild.},

A generalized adaptive (N+M)-tuplet clusters loss function together with the identity-aware hard-negative mining and online positive mining scheme are proposed for identity-invariant FER. It reduces the computational burden of deep metric learning, and alleviates the difficulty of threshold validation and anchor selection.

  abstract = {In the era of mobile big data, data driven intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) applications are becoming widespread, and knowledge-based reasoning is one of the essential tasks of these applications. While most knowledge-based reasoning work is conducted with knowledge graph, ontology-based reasoning method can inherently achieve higher level intelligence by leveraging both explicit and tacit knowledge in specific domains, and its performance is determined by precise refinement of the inference rules. However, most ontology-based reasoning work concentrates on semantic reasoning in a single ontology, and fail to utilize association of multiple ontologies in various domains to extend reasoning capacity. This is even the case for the IoT applications where knowledge from multiple domains needs to be utilized. To overcome this issue, we propose a deep learning-based method to associate multiple ontology rule bases, thereby discover new inference rules. In our method, we first use a regression tree model to determine the threshold value for parameters in inference rules that constitute the ontology rule base, avoiding the influence of uncertainty factors on knowledge reasoning results. Then, a two-way GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural network with attention mechanism is used to discover semantic relations among the rule bases of ontologies. Therefore, the association of multiple ontology rule bases is realized, and the rule base of knowledge reasoning is expanded by acquiring some unspecified rules. To the best our knowledge, this work is the first one to leverage deep learning in reasoning with multiple ontologies. In order to verify the effectiveness of our method, we apply it in a real traffic safety monitoring application by relating rule bases of a vehicle ontology and a traffic management ontology, and achieve effective knowledge reasoning.},

Changes in emotions can cause differences in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which show different emotional states and are not easy to disguise. EEG-based emotion recognition has been widely used in human-computer interaction, medical diagnosis, military, and other fields. In this paper, we describe the common steps of an emotion recognition algorithm based on EEG from data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection to classifier. Then, we review the existing EEG-based emotional recognition methods, as well as assess their classification effect. This paper will help researchers quickly understand the basic theory of emotion recognition and provide references for the future development of EEG. Moreover, emotion is an important representation of safety psychology.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The key factor for video person reidentification is to effectively exploit both spatial and temporal clues from video sequences. In this work, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Correlation and Topology Learning framework (CTL) to pursue discriminative and robust representation by modeling cross-scale spatial-temporal correlation. Specifically, CTL utilizes a CNN backbone and a key-points estimator to extract semantic local features from human body at multiple granularities as graph nodes. It explores a context-reinforced topology to construct multiscale graphs by considering both global contextual information and physical connections of human body. Moreover, a 3D graph convolution and a cross-scale graph convolution are designed, which facilitate direct cross-spacetime and cross-scale information propagation for capturing hierarchical spatial-temporal dependencies and structural information. By jointly performing the two convolutions, CTL effectively mines comprehensive clues that are complementary with appearance information to enhance representational capacity. Extensive experiments on two video benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method and the state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \textbackslash textbf\{S\}hifted \textbackslash textbf\{win\}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Due to technology, students now have more alternatives to study and improve skills at their own pace. In terms of assessments, there has been a shift toward online tests. The absence of a physical invigilator is perhaps the most significant impediment in online mode. Henceforth, online proctoring services are becoming more popular, and AI-powered proctoring solutions are becoming demanding. In this project, we describe a strategy for avoiding the physical presence of a proctor during the test by developing a multi-modal system. We captured video using a webcam along active window capture. The face of the test taker is identified and analyzed to forecast his emotions. To identify his head pose, his feature points are identified. Furthermore, aspects including a phone, a book, or the presence of another person are detected. This combination of models creates an intelligent rule-based inference system which is capable of determining if any malpractice took place during the examination.},

The present review examines this model in terms of whether different types of emotion-evocative stimuli are associated with discrete and invariant patterns of responding in each response system, how such responses are structured, and if such responses converge across different response systems. Across response systems, the bulk of the available evidence favours the idea that measures of emotional responding reflect dimensions rather than discrete states. In addition, experiential, physiological, and behavioural response systems are associated with unique sources of variance, which in turn limits the magnitude of convergence across measures. Accordingly, the authors suggest that there is no ``gold standard'' measure of emotional responding. Rather, experiential, physiological, and behavioural measures are all relevant to understanding emotion and cannot be assumed to be interchangeable.},

Twenty-seven young adults were video recorded by a stereo camera while they viewed video clips intended to elicit spontaneous emotion expression. Each video frame was manually coded for presence, absence, and intensity of facial action units according to the facial action unit coding system. Action units are the smallest visibly discriminable changes in facial action; they may occur individually and in combinations to comprise more molar facial expressions. To provide a baseline for use in future research, protocols and benchmarks for automated action unit intensity measurement are reported.

  abstract = {Emotions have always been an intriguing topic in everyday life as well as in science. As robots are starting to move from industry halls to our private homes, emotions have become a vital theme for the field of human\textendash robot interaction. Since Darwin, research suggests facial expressions are associated with emotions. Facial expressions could provide an ideal tool for a natural, social human\textendash robot interaction. Despite a growing body of research on the implementation of emotions in robots (mostly based on facial expressions), systematic research on users' emotions and facial expressions towards robots remains largely neglected (cf. Arkin and Moshkina in Calvo R, D'Mello S, Gratch J, Kappas A (eds) The Oxford handbook of affective computing. Oxford University Press, New York, pp 483\textendash 493, 2015 on challenges in effective testing in affective human\textendash robot interaction). We experimentally investigated the multilevel phenomenon of emotions by using a multi-method approach. Since self-reports of emotions are prone to biases such as social desirability, we supplemented it by an objective behavioral measurement. By using the Facial Action Coding System we analyzed the facial expressions of 62 participants who watched the entertainment robot dinosaur Pleo either in a friendly interaction or being tortured. Participants differed in the type and frequency of Action Units displayed as well as in their self-reported feelings depending on the type of treatment they had watched (friendly or torture). In line with a previous study by Rosenthal-von der P\"utten et al. (Int J Soc Robot 5(1):17\textendash 34, 2013. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12369-012-0173-8), participants reported feeling more positive after the friendly video and more negative after the torture video. In the torture condition, participants furthermore showed a wide range of different Action Units primarily associated with negative emotions. For example, the Action Unit 4 (``Brow Lowerer'') that is common in negative emotions such as anger and sadness was displayed more frequently in the torture condition than in the friendly condition. The Action Unit 12 (``Lip Corner Puller'') however, an Action Unit commonly associated with joy, was present in both conditions and thus not necessarily predictive of positive emotions. The findings indicate the importance for a thorough investigation of the variables of emotional facial expressions. In investigating the Action Units participants display due to an emotional situation, we aim to provide information on spontaneous facial expressions towards a robot that could also serve as guidance for automatic approaches.},

  abstract = {As robots are starting to enter not only our professional lives but also our domestic lives, new questions arise: What about the emotional impact of getting into contact with this new `species'? Can robots elicit emotional reactions from humans? Assuming that humans may react in the same way towards robots as they do towards humans (Media Equation), it is important to investigate the factors influencing this emotional experience. But systematic research in this area remains scarce. An exception is the study conducted by Rosenthal-von der P\"utten, Kr\"amer, Hoffmann, Sobieraj, and Eimler in 2013 addressing the question of emotional reactions towards a robot experimentally. Taking the study by Rosenthal-von der P\"utten et al. as a starting point and following their suggested multi-method approach as well as Scherer's assumption about the five components of emotions, we added the motor expression component to further investigate the multilevel phenomenon of emotional reactions towards robots. We used the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to analyze the facial expressions of participants viewing videos of the robot dinosaur Pleo in a friendly interaction or being tortured. Participants showed Action Units associated with intrinsic unpleasantness more frequently in the torture-video-condition than during the reception of the normal video. Participants also reported more negative feelings after the torture video than the normal video. The findings indicate the importance of investigating emotional reactions towards robots for a social robot to be an ideal companion. Furthermore, this paper shows that the application of FACS to research in human-robot interaction is a fruitful and insightful enhancement to commonly used self-report measures. We conclude this paper with some recommendations for improving the design of social robots.},

  abstract = {Symbolic artificial intelligence is motivated by the hypothesis that symbol manipulation is both necessary and sufficient for intelligence. In symbolic systems, knowledge is encoded in terms of explicit symbolic structures, and inferences are based on handcrafted rules that sequentially manipulate these structures. Such systems have been quite successful, for example, in modeling in-depth natural language processing, episodic memory, and symbolic problem solving. However, much of the inferencing for everyday natural language understanding appears to take place immediately, without conscious control, apparently based on associations with past experience. This type of reasoning is difficult to model in the symbolic framework. In contrast, subsymbolic (distributed connectionist) networks represent knowledge in terms of correlations, coded in the weights of the network. For a given input, the network computes the most likely answer given its past experience. A number of human-like information processing properties such as learning from examples, context sensitivity, generalization, robustness of behavior, and intuitive reasoning emerge automatically in subsymbolic systems. The major motivation for subsymbolic AI, therefore, is to give a better account for cognitive phenomena that are statistical, or intuitive, in nature.{$<>$}},

Beginning with their success in natural language processing, transformer-based models have succeeded in several other fields, such as image and automatic speech recognition. In addition to them being trained on unimodal information, many transformer-based models have been proposed for multimodal information. In the field of multimodal learning, a common problem encountered is that of insufficient multimodal training data. This study attempted to address this problem by proposing a simple albeit effective method using 1) unimodal pre-trained transformer models as encoders for each modal input, and 2) another set of transformer layers to fuse their output representations. Further, the proposed method was evaluated through a series of experiments on two common benchmarks: CMU-MOSI and MM-IMDb. Consequently, the proposed model obtained state-of-the-art performances in both benchmarks, and its robustness in reducing the amount of training data was demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Traditional computer vision approaches, based on neural networks (NN), are typically trained on a large amount of image data. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss between a prediction and a given class label, the NN and its visual embedding space are learned to fulfill a given task. However, due to the sole dependence on the image data distribution of the training domain, these models tend to fail when applied to a target domain that differs from their source domain. To learn a more robust NN to domain shifts, we propose the knowledge graph neural network (KG-NN), a neuro-symbolic approach that supervises the training using image-data-invariant auxiliary knowledge. The auxiliary knowledge is first encoded in a knowledge graph with respective concepts and their relationships, which is then transformed into a dense vector representation via an embedding method. Using a contrastive loss function, KG-NN learns to adapt its visual embedding space and thus its weights according to the image-data invariant knowledge graph embedding space. We evaluate KG-NN on visual transfer learning tasks for classification using the mini-ImageNet dataset and its derivatives, as well as road sign recognition datasets from Germany and China. The results show that a visual model trained with a knowledge graph as a trainer outperforms a model trained with cross-entropy in all experiments, in particular when the domain gap increases. Besides better performance and stronger robustness to domain shifts, these KG-NN adapts to multiple datasets and classes without suffering heavily from catastrophic forgetting.},

  abstract = {The ability to simultaneously localize a robot and accurately map its surroundings is considered by many to be a key prerequisite of truly autonomous robots. However, few approaches to this problem scale up to handle the very large number of landmarks present in real environments. Kalman filter-based algorithms, for example, require time quadratic in the number of landmarks to incorporate each sensor observation. This paper presents FastSLAM, an algorithm that recursively estimates the full posterior distribution over robot pose and landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on an exact factorization of the posterior into a product of conditional landmark distributions and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm has been run successfully on as many as 50,000 landmarks, environments far beyond the reach of previous approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the FastSLAM algorithm on both simulated and realworld data.},

Despite this, facial expression recognition (FER) remains a challenging problem in computer vision. Inconsistencies in the sophistication of FER and variations among expression classes are often ignored in most facial expression detection systems due to the various expressions of emotion and unpredictable environmental influences. An HybridEI (Hybrid Edge Intelligence), a smartly face detection system trained in a more powerful cloud environment and inferenced at the resource-constrained edge environment, is proposed for FER in this study. Face classification complexity, memory minimization, and computational time were all well addressed by our proposed HybridEI approach. With an accuracy of 82.78\% and 1.27 frames per second (FPS), the experimental results on FER-2013 dataset demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority over other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, both the memory capacity and computational time were significantly decreased.},

In this paper we chose to use a PAD Emotional Space [5] to simulate the emotional state of a NAO Robot (NAO is the name of a humanoid robot developed and commercialized by Aldebaran Robotics). But one difficulty is to write an algorithm that makes evolve the emotional state according to external and internal stimuli. Simulating a coherent Emotional State over the time is a real challenge for designing a virtual personality. As human emotions are fuzzy by nature, many researchers explored using Fuzzy State Machine [6], [7] or Fuzzy Logic [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] to control the emotions of a virtual character or robot. Following the same approach, in this paper we propose to use a Fuzzy Control System [13] to control the emotional state of a NAO robot by injecting attractors in his PAD Emotional Space. Fuzzy Control Systems are usually good controller of uncertainty and easy to write thanks to their syntax close to the human language. The result of our experiments showed that the evolution of the Emotional State of our NAO robot was smooth and coherent with the situation met when interacting with humans. Moreover with different set of rules it becomes easy to switch the personality of the robot (meaning the robot can react differently to the same stimuli according to the different set of rules used).},

This is a particularly difficult challenge because of the large appearance changes produced by differences in view angle, lighting circumstances, and the individual's varied postures.

The proposed model consists of two stages, 1) build an ontology as a knowledge base for a specific domain and data mining concepts, and 2) build the ontology-based knowledge map model for representing and storing the knowledge mined on the crop datasets.

Errors in test sets are numerous and widespread: we estimate an average of at least 3.3\% errors across the 10 datasets, where for example label errors comprise at least 6\% of the ImageNet validation set. Putative label errors are identified using confident learning algorithms and then human-validated via crowdsourcing (51\% of the algorithmically-flagged candidates are indeed erroneously labeled, on average across the datasets). Traditionally, machine learning practitioners choose which model to deploy based on test accuracy - our findings advise caution here, proposing that judging models over correctly labeled test sets may be more useful, especially for noisy real-world datasets. Surprisingly, we find that lower capacity models may be practically more useful than higher capacity models in real-world datasets with high proportions of erroneously labeled data. For example, on ImageNet with corrected labels: ResNet-18 outperforms ResNet-50 if the prevalence of originally mislabeled test examples increases by just 6\%. On CIFAR-10 with corrected labels: VGG-11 outperforms VGG-19 if the prevalence of originally mislabeled test examples increases by just 5\%.

This paper points out the limitations of these two approaches, and proposes a hybrid cognitive model of central symbolic processing on the conscious level, and distributed subsymbolic processing on the unconscious level (C/U model). The advantages of the C/U model are clarified by explaining various functions realized by the model: multistage knowledge retrieval, recognition and inference with situated knowledge, inductive learning, and creative inference. Those functions are realized by utilizing the close interaction between the two levels.

  abstract = {Computational context understanding refers to an agent's ability to fuse disparate sources of information for decision-making and is, therefore, generally regarded as a prerequisite for sophisticated machine reasoning capabilities, such as in artificial intelligence (AI). Data-driven and knowledge-driven methods are two classical techniques in the pursuit of such machine sense-making capability. However, while data-driven methods seek to model the statistical regularities of events by making observations in the real-world, they remain difficult to interpret and they lack mechanisms for naturally incorporating external knowledge. Conversely, knowledge-driven methods, combine structured knowledge bases, perform symbolic reasoning based on axiomatic principles, and are more interpretable in their inferential processing; however, they often lack the ability to estimate the statistical salience of an inference. To combat these issues, we propose the use of hybrid AI methodology as a general framework for combining the strengths of both approaches. Specifically, we inherit the concept of neuro-symbolism as a way of using knowledge-bases to guide the learning progress of deep neural networks. We further ground our discussion in two applications of neuro-symbolism and, in both cases, show that our systems maintain interpretability while achieving comparable performance, relative to the state-of-the-art.},

As a solution to the indoor area coverage problem, an indoor positioning system based on GPS repeaters and a modified positioning algorithm is proposed, designed, and tested. A prototype indoor positioning system for 1D/2D positioning is built using directional GPS antennas and low-noise amplifiers (LNA). The modified positioning algorithm is used for the real time processing of captured live GPS data. All the system components are integrated and positioning is obtained for the evaluation of the system performance. Results of the experiments show that the proposed system can be used for indoor positioning in locations where there is no GPS signal reception. The proposed system facilitates the continuation of GPS services indoors with hardware additions to the buildings and only a software update to a standard GPS receiver. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {In 2000, the Cohn-Kanade (CK) database was released for the purpose of promoting research into automatically detecting individual facial expressions. Since then, the CK database has become one of the most widely used test-beds for algorithm development and evaluation. During this period, three limitations have become apparent: 1) While AU codes are well validated, emotion labels are not, as they refer to what was requested rather than what was actually performed, 2) The lack of a common performance metric against which to evaluate new algorithms, and 3) Standard protocols for common databases have not emerged. As a consequence, the CK database has been used for both AU and emotion detection (even though labels for the latter have not been validated), comparison with benchmark algorithms is missing, and use of random subsets of the original database makes meta-analyses difficult. To address these and other concerns, we present the Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) database. The number of sequences is increased by 22\% and the number of subjects by 27\%. The target expression for each sequence is fully FACS coded and emotion labels have been revised and validated. In addition to this, non-posed sequences for several types of smiles and their associated metadata have been added. We present baseline results using Active Appearance Models (AAMs) and a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier using a leave-one-out subject cross-validation for both AU and emotion detection for the posed data. The emotion and AU labels, along with the extended image data and tracked landmarks will be made available July 2010.},

In this experimental study, we apply a state-of-the-art object detector (PointPillars), previously used for LiDAR 3D data, to such 3+1D radar data (where 1D refers to Doppler). In ablation studies, we first explore the benefits of the additional elevation information, together with that of Doppler, radar cross section and temporal accumulation, in the context of multi-class road user detection. We subsequently compare object detection performance on the radar and LiDAR point clouds, object class-wise and as a function of distance. To facilitate our experimental study, we present the novel View-of-Delft (VoD) automotive dataset. It contains 8693 frames of synchronized and calibrated 64-layer LiDAR-, (stereo) camera-, and 3+1D radar-data acquired in complex, urban traffic. It consists of 123106 3D bounding box annotations of both moving and static objects, including 26587 pedestrian, 10800 cyclist and 26949 car labels. Our results show that object detection on 64-layer LiDAR data still outperforms that on 3+1D radar data, but the addition of elevation information and integration of successive radar scans helps close the gap.

  abstract = {Automatic analysis of human facial expression is a challenging problem with many applications. Most of the existing automated systems for facial expression analysis attempt to recognize a few prototypic emotional expressions, such as anger and happiness. Instead of representing another approach to machine analysis of prototypic facial expressions of emotion, the method presented in this paper attempts to handle a large range of human facial behavior by recognizing facial muscle actions that produce expressions. Virtually all of the existing vision systems for facial muscle action detection deal only with frontal-view face images and cannot handle temporal dynamics of facial actions. In this paper, we present a system for automatic recognition of facial action units (AUs) and their temporal models from long, profile-view face image sequences. We exploit particle filtering to track 15 facial points in an input face-profile sequence, and we introduce facial-action-dynamics recognition from continuous video input using temporal rules. The algorithm performs both automatic segmentation of an input video into facial expressions pictured and recognition of temporal segments (i.e., onset, apex, offset) of 27 AUs occurring alone or in a combination in the input face-profile video. A recognition rate of 87\% is achieved.},

The present study investigated the characteristics of real and fake facial expressions of representative emotions (happiness, contentment, anger, and sadness) in a two-dimensional emotion model. Participants viewed a series of visual stimuli designed to induce real or fake emotions and were signaled to produce a facial expression at a set time. From the participant's expression data, feature variables (i.e., the degree and variance of movement, and vibration level) involving the facial micromovements at the onset of the expression were analyzed. The results indicated significant differences in the feature variables between the real and fake expression conditions. The differences varied according to facial regions as a function of emotions. This study provides appraisal criteria for identifying the authenticity of facial expressions that are applicable to future research and the design of emotion recognition systems.},

We present fundamental explanations to help better understand the nature of MSAs. In particular, we demonstrate the following properties of MSAs and Vision Transformers (ViTs): (1) MSAs improve not only accuracy but also generalization by flattening the loss landscapes. Such improvement is primarily attributable to their data specificity, not long-range dependency. On the other hand, ViTs suffer from non-convex losses. Large datasets and loss landscape smoothing methods alleviate this problem; (2) MSAs and Convs exhibit opposite behaviors. For example, MSAs are low-pass filters, but Convs are high-pass filters. Therefore, MSAs and Convs are complementary; (3) Multi-stage neural networks behave like a series connection of small individual models. In addition, MSAs at the end of a stage play a key role in prediction. Based on these insights, we propose AlterNet, a model in which Conv blocks at the end of a stage are replaced with MSA blocks. AlterNet outperforms CNNs not only in large data regimes but also in small data regimes. The code is available at https://github.com/xxxnell/how-do-vits-work.},

The problem with these systems was they were not self-adapting systems nor emotion-based mood enhancing systems. Our Proposed system combines real-world data for emotion awareness, sensing, learning, and decision-making. The proposed system is milestone in Smart home journey because, it is enhancing the systems security, efficiency and user experience. Thus, we present a cognitive intelligent home automation system featuring computer vision, environmental sensing, data processing, learning, and adaptation capabilities. Face recognition-based door access control used in the proposed system allows access only to authorized user. Further, Convolutional Neural Network and support vector machine algorithm-based emotion detection is implemented. The system recognizes emotions on the user's face and enhances user experience by controlling the ambient light as per the mood/emotion of the user. To implement system, we have used the methodology with different modes of operations such as privileged mode, non-privileged mode, intelligent mode, manual mode. We are proposing the ``sensovisual'' term in this paper which is combination of the sensor and visual method for smart home automation.},

The object of the challenge is to recognize micro-expression in two provided databases, including holdout-database recognition and composite database recognition. Considering the small size of the databases, we follow a rout of transfer learning to implement convolutional neural network to recognize the micro-expression. ResNet10 pre-trained on ImageNet dataset was fine-tuned on macro-expression datasets with large size and then on the provided micro-expression datasets. Experimental results show that the method can achieve weighted average recall (WAR) of 0.561 and unweighted average recall (UAR) of 0.389 in Holdout-database Evaluation Task, and F1 Score of 0.64 in Composite Database Evaluation Task, which are much higher than what baseline methods (LBP-TOP, HOOF, HOG3D) can achieve.},

Recently,semi-supervisedlearning exhibits promisingemotion recognition performance by involving unlabeled EEG data into model training. However, if we first build a graph to characterize the sample similarities and then perform label propagation on this graph, these two steps cannotwell collaborate with each other. In this paper, we propose an OptimalGraph coupledSemi-Supervised Learning (OGSSL) model for EEG emotion recognition by unifying the adaptive graph learning and emotion recognition into a single objective. Besides, we improve the label indicator matrix of unlabeledsamples in order to directly obtain theiremotional states. Moreover, the key EEG frequency bands and brain regions in emotion expression are automatically recognized by the projectionmatrix of OGSSL. Experimental results on the SEED-IV data set demonstrate that 1) OGSSL achieves excellent average accuracies of 76.51\%, 77.08\% and 81.29\% in three cross-sessionemotion recognition tasks, 2) OGSSL is competent for discriminative EEG feature selection in emotion recognition, and 3) the Gamma frequency band, the left/righttemporal, prefrontal,and (central) parietal lobes are identified to be more correlated with the occurrence of emotions.},

The literature review was conducted on: IEEEXplore, ScienceDirect, Scopus, PubMed, ACM. Inclusion criteria were the presence of an automatic emotion recognition algorithm and the enrollment of at least 2 patients in the experimental protocol. The review process followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Moreover, the works were analysed according to a reference model to deeply examine both clinical and technical topics. 52 scientific papers passed inclusion criteria. Most clinical scenarios involved neurodevelopmental, neurological and psychiatric disorders with the aims of diagnosing, monitoring, or treating emotional symptoms. The most adopted signals are video and audio, while supervised shallow learning is mostly used for emotion recognition. A poor study design, tiny samples, and the absence of a control group emerged as methodological weaknesses. Heterogeneity of performance metrics, datasets and algorithms challenges results comparability, robustness, reliability and reproducibility.},

The inclusion of expression photographs meant that readers could form their own opinions and could, like Darwin, survey others for their interpretations. As such, the images provided an evidence base and an `open source'. Since Darwin, increases in the representativeness and realism of emotional expressions have come from the use of composite images, colour, multiple views and dynamic displays. Research on understanding emotional expressions has been aided by the use of computer graphics to interpolate parametrically between different expressions and to extrapolate exaggerations. This review tracks the developments in how emotions are illustrated and studied and considers where to go next.},

Concepts are mapped in this space and their mutual geometric distance is related to their conceptual similarity. The geometric distance between concepts implicitly defines a sub-symbolic relationship net, which can be seen as a new "sub- symbolic semantic layer" automatically added to the Cyc ontology. Users queries can also be mapped in the same conceptual space, and evoke similar ontology concepts. As a result the agent can exploit this feature, attempting to retrieve ontological concepts that are not easily reachable by means of the traditional ontology reasoning engine.},

Nevertheless, it is not always possible to monitor the effect of a multitude of variables involved in behavioral phenomena. In several different industries, Emotion Perception or Artificial Emotional Intelligence is now a \$20 billion research area with applications. In a variety of ways, artificial emotional intelligence can operate through industries. Emotional readings may also be used by AI as relating to decision, such as in advertising campaigns. In terms of temporal dynamics, a powerful learning method is required to extract high-level representations of emotional responses. In terms of spatial dispersion, a learning process strategy is required to extract high-level assessment of emotional states. The recurrent neural network outperforms linear models in terms of prediction accuracy. A recurrent model is proposed in this paper to forecast the pattern between the variables of age, gender, occupation, marital status, and education in order to predict the EI. The appropriate recurrent model is capable of predicting EI with important correlations in most of its dimensions and could demonstrate the advantage over regression models in predicting EI using sociological parameters. This model will estimate the level of EI in the various occupational, professional, gender and age groups and provide a planning basis for addressing possible deficiencies in each group.},

Although many AC researchers have traditionally attempted to remain agnostic to the different emotion theories proposed by psychologists, the affective technologies being developed are rife with theoretical assumptions that impact their effectiveness. Hence, an informed and integrated examination of emotion theories from multiple areas will need to become part of computing practice if truly effective real-world systems are to be achieved. This survey discusses theoretical perspectives that view emotions as expressions, embodiments, outcomes of cognitive appraisal, social constructs, products of neural circuitry, and psychological interpretations of basic feelings. It provides meta-analyses on existing reviews of affect detection systems that focus on traditional affect detection modalities like physiology, face, and voice, and also reviews emerging research on more novel channels such as text, body language, and complex multimodal systems. This survey explicitly explores the multidisciplinary foundation that underlies all AC applications by describing how AC researchers have incorporated psychological theories of emotion and how these theories affect research questions, methods, results, and their interpretations. In this way, models and methods can be compared, and emerging insights from various disciplines can be more expertly integrated.},

We first examine relationships between users' affective ratings and personality scales in the context of prior observations, and then study linear and non-linear physiological correlates of emotion and personality. Our analysis suggests that the emotion-personality relationship is better captured by non-linear rather than linear statistics. We finally attempt binary emotion and personality trait recognition using physiological features. Experimental results cumulatively confirm that personality differences are better revealed while comparing user responses to emotionally homogeneous videos, and above-chance recognition is achieved for both affective and personality dimensions.},

Emotion portrayal within conversation plays a significant role in the semantics of a sentence. However, emotion is not only biologically determined but is also influenced by the environment. Therefore, cultural differences exist in some aspects of emotions, and it is important for the next generation of computer systems to adapt the cross-cultural difference in order to enable more naturalistic interactions between humans and machines. In this paper, we investigate the suitability of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures based on recurrent neural network (RNN) variants with explicit attention modelling to bridge the gap across different cultures (German and Hungarian) for emotion prediction in video. Three different attention based network architectures are proposed in this work:- early attention fusion, extended multi-attention fusion and attention-based encoder-decoder. Our RNN variants with explicit attention modelling approach achieves very promising Concordance Correlation Coefficient results, which outperform the baseline on Arousal of 0.637 vs. 0.614 (baseline), for Valence of 0.689 vs. 0.615 and for Liking of 0.625 vs. 0.222.},

However, insights into this topic are an important prerequisite when discussing, for example, ethical issues regarding the question of what role we (want to) allow robots to play in our lives. In line with the Media Equation, humans may react towards robots as they do towards humans, making it all the more important to carefully investigate the preconditions and consequences of contact with robots. Based on assumptions on the socialness of reactions towards robots and anecdotal evidence of emotional attachments to robots (e.g. Klamer and BenAllouch in Trappl R. (ed.), Proceedings of EMCSR 2010, Vienna, 2010; Klamer and BenAllouch in Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI-2010), Atlanta, GA. ACM, New York, 2010; Kr\"amer et al. in Appl. Artif. Intell. 25(6):474\textendash 502, 2011), we conducted a study that provides further insights into the question of whether humans show emotional reactions towards Ugobe's Pleo, which is shown in different situations. We used a 2\texttimes 2 design with one between-subjects factor ``prior interaction with the robot'' (never seen the robot before vs. 10-minute interaction with the robot) and a within-subject factor ``type of video'' (friendly interaction video vs. torture video). Following a multi-method approach, we assessed participants' physiological arousal and self-reported emotions as well as their general evaluation of the videos and the robot. In line with our hypotheses, participants showed increased physiological arousal during the reception of the torture video as compared to the normal video. They also reported fewer positive and more negative feelings after the torture video and expressed empathic concern for the robot. It appears that the acquaintance with the robot does not play a role, as ``prior interaction with the robot'' showed no effect.},

The techniques range from heuristically derived hand-crafted feature-based traditional machine learning algorithms, feature selection algorithms to the hierarchically self-evolving feature-based Deep Learning algorithms. The transient and chaotic nature of the WiFi/Bluetooth fingerprint data along with different signal sensitivity of different device configurations presents numerous challenges that influence the performance of the indoor localization system in the wild. This article is intended to offer a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey on machine learning techniques that have recently been adopted for localization purposes. Hence, we review the applicability of machine learning techniques in this domain along with basic localization principles, applications, and the underlying problems and challenges associated with the existing systems. We also articulate the recent advances and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to visualize the possible future directions in the research field of indoor localization.},

We use the length of the activity vector to represent the probability that the entity exists and its orientation to represent the instantiation parameters. Active capsules at one level make predictions, via transformation matrices, for the instantiation parameters of higher-level capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active. We show that a discrimininatively trained, multi-layer capsule system achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and is considerably better than a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these results we use an iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism: A lower-level capsule prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity vectors have a big scalar product with the prediction coming from the lower-level capsule.},

  abstract = {Depth estimation in computer vision and robotics is most commonly done via stereo vision (stereopsis), in which images from two cameras are used to triangulate and estimate distances. However, there are also numerous monocular visual cues\textemdash such as texture variations and gradients, defocus, color/haze, etc.\textemdash that have heretofore been little exploited in such systems. Some of these cues apply even in regions without texture, where stereo would work poorly. In this paper, we apply a Markov Random Field (MRF) learning algorithm to capture some of these monocular cues, and incorporate them into a stereo system. We show that by adding monocular cues to stereo (triangulation) ones, we obtain significantly more accurate depth estimates than is possible using either monocular or stereo cues alone. This holds true for a large variety of environments, including both indoor environments and unstructured outdoor environments containing trees/forests, buildings, etc. Our approach is general, and applies to incorporating monocular cues together with any off-the-shelf stereo system.},

When such functions are approximated by neural networks this introduces a compelling alternative to the more common multi-dimensional array representation. Recent work on such Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) has shown that - following careful architecture search - INRs can outperform established compression methods such as JPEG (e.g. Dupont et al., 2021). In this paper, we propose crucial steps towards making such ideas scalable: Firstly, we employ stateof-the-art network sparsification techniques to drastically improve compression. Secondly, introduce the first method allowing for sparsification to be employed in the inner-loop of commonly used Meta-Learning algorithms, drastically improving both compression and the computational cost of learning INRs. The generality of this formalism allows us to present results on diverse data modalities such as images, manifolds, signed distance functions, 3D shapes and scenes, several of which establish new state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract = {Reasoning is an essential part of human intelligence and thus has been a long-standing goal in artificial intelligence research. With the recent success of deep learning, incorporating reasoning with deep learning systems, i.e., neuro-symbolic AI has become a major field of interest. We propose the Neuro-Symbolic Forward Reasoner (NSFR), a new approach for reasoning tasks taking advantage of differentiable forward-chaining using first-order logic. The key idea is to combine differentiable forward-chaining reasoning with object-centric (deep) learning. Differentiable forward-chaining reasoning computes logical entailments smoothly, i.e., it deduces new facts from given facts and rules in a differentiable manner. The object-centric learning approach factorizes raw inputs into representations in terms of objects. Thus, it allows us to provide a consistent framework to perform the forward-chaining inference from raw inputs. NSFR factorizes the raw inputs into the object-centric representations, converts them into probabilistic ground atoms, and finally performs differentiable forward-chaining inference using weighted rules for inference. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations on object-centric reasoning data sets, 2D Kandinsky patterns and 3D CLEVR-Hans, and a variety of tasks show the effectiveness and advantage of our approach.},

Detecting emotional state of a person from textual data is an active research field along with recognizing emotions from facial and audio information. Several methods were given to recognize emotion from text in previous years. This paper proposed a new architecture (a keyword based approach) to recognize emotions from text. In case of recognizing emotion from a piece of text document or a blog, any human can do this better than a machine only problem is he/she takes time. Proposed emotion detector system takes a text document and the emotion word ontology as inputs and produces one of the six emotion classes (i.e. love, sadness, joy, fear and surprise, anger) as the output. Every input text contains some short stories which are firstly read and assigned an emotion class manually and then that emotion class is compared to the output of the proposed system to check the accuracy of the Proposed Emotion Detector System. It is found that the Proposed Emotion Detector System produces output with the accuracy of more than 75\%.},

  abstract = {Recognition of natural emotions from human faces is an interesting topic with a wide range of potential applications, such as human-computer interaction, automated tutoring systems, image and video retrieval, smart environments, and driver warning systems. Traditionally, facial emotion recognition systems have been evaluated on laboratory controlled data, which is not representative of the environment faced in real-world applications. To robustly recognize the facial emotions in real-world natural situations, this paper proposes an approach called extreme sparse learning, which has the ability to jointly learn a dictionary (set of basis) and a nonlinear classification model. The proposed approach combines the discriminative power of extreme learning machine with the reconstruction property of sparse representation to enable accurate classification when presented with noisy signals and imperfect data recorded in natural settings. In addition, this paper presents a new local spatio-temporal descriptor that is distinctive and pose-invariant. The proposed framework is able to achieve the state-of-the-art recognition accuracy on both acted and spontaneous facial emotion databases.},

Because of high temporal resolution and low acquisition costs, EEG signals have become one of the dominant brain signals for the analysis and recognition of the emotions induced by the nervous system. In this study, we aim to explain brain connectivity using graph models and assess the performance of graph features extracted from brain connectivity. We propose two models to build graphs for brain connectivity and compare their capabilities in expressing the emotional state of a subject. We have used the DEAP dataset for this experiment. Our proposed models show an accuracy increase of approximately 5\% compared to solely using brain connectivity features. Another advantage of this approach is that by making the connectivity graph sparser, we could considerably reduce the size of the feature vector compared to the conventional brain connectivity feature vector.},

These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results.

However, a long-standing criticism against neural network models is the lack of interpretability, which not only reduces the reliability of neural NLP systems but also limits the scope of their applications in areas where interpretability is essential (e.g., health care applications). In response, the increasing interest in interpreting neural NLP models has spurred a diverse array of interpretation methods over recent years. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of various interpretation methods for neural models in NLP. We first stretch out a high-level taxonomy for interpretation methods in NLP, i.e., training-based approaches, test-based approaches, and hybrid approaches. Next, we describe sub-categories in each category in detail, e.g., influence-function based methods, KNN-based methods, attention-based models, saliency-based methods, perturbation-based methods, etc. We point out deficiencies of current methods and suggest some avenues for future research.},

Although simple rule extraction has received a lot of research attention, to further develop hybrid learning models that include both symbolic and subsymbolic knowledge and that learn autonomously, it is necessary to study autonomous learning of both subsymbolic and symbolic knowledge in integrated architectures. This paper describes knowledge extraction from neural reinforcement learning. It includes two approaches towards extracting plan knowledge: the extraction of explicit, symbolic rules from neural reinforcement learning, and the extraction of complete plans. This work points to the creation of a general framework for achieving the subsymbolic to symbolic transition in an integrated autonomous learning framework.},

While many ideas have been proposed,1 the specific adaptive functions of expressing emotion on the face have largely remained untested since Darwin proposed a set of expressive functional principles over 130 years ago.2 Recently, we showed that expressions of fear and disgust alter the biomechanical properties of the face, such that fear increases while disgust decreases sensory exposure.3 Additional vector flow analyses presented here reveal that anger and surprise expressions may similarly be shaped by sensory contraction and expansion action tendencies. An examination of the temporal dynamics of sensory modulation may reveal a general principle shaping expressive form rather than a specific adaptation shaping fear and disgust. Furthermore, if sensory modulation is a general principle, this function should be present across species rather than only in humans. Although facial morphology differs across species, detailed examination of sensory intake in different species may reveal the origins of facial expressions inherited by humans.},

Neuro-symbolic models have already demonstrated the capability to outperform state-of-the-art deep learning models in domains such as image and video reasoning. They have also been shown to obtain high accuracy with significantly less training data than traditional models. Due to the recency of the field's emergence and relative sparsity of published results, the performance characteristics of these models are not well understood. In this paper, we describe and analyze the performance characteristics of three recent neuro-symbolic models. We find that symbolic models have less potential parallelism than traditional neural models due to complex control flow and low-operational-intensity operations, such as scalar multiplication and tensor addition. However, the neural aspect of computation dominates the symbolic part in cases where they are clearly separable. We also find that data movement poses a potential bottleneck, as it does in many ML workloads.},

However, the data mismatch and label distortion between the training (source) set and the testing (target) set significantly degrade the performances when developing the SER systems. Additionally, most emotion-related speech datasets are highly contextualized and limited in size. The manual annotation cost is often too high leading to an active investigation of unsupervised cross-corpus SER techniques. In this paper, we propose a framework in unsupervised cross-corpus emotion recognition using multi-source corpus in a data augmentation manner. We introduced Corpus-Aware Emotional CycleGAN (CAEmoCyGAN) including a corpus-aware attention mechanism to aggregate each source datasets to generate the synthetic target sample. We choose the widely used speech emotion corpora the IEMOCAP and the VAM as sources and the MSP-Podcast as the target. By generating synthetic target-aware samples to augment source datasets and by directly training on this augmented dataset, our proposed multi-source target-aware augmentation method outperforms other baseline models in activation and valence classification.},

Teachers can check by entering the breakout room of each group in turn, but teachers cannot see the whole at once. AI teachers have the ability to leave the voice of group activities as text. By utilizing this function, teachers can now give appropriate advice to each group. However, it takes some time to understand the student situation from the texts. Therefore, we added the emotion analysis to this function to improve the understanding the situation so that teachers can visually grasp the student's situation.

We propose a method where CNN-predicted dense depth maps are naturally fused together with depth measurements obtained from direct monocular SLAM, based on a scheme that privileges depth prediction in image locations where monocular SLAM approaches tend to fail, e.g. along low-textured regions, and vice-versa. We demonstrate the use of depth prediction to estimate the absolute scale of the reconstruction, hence overcoming one of the major limitations of monocular SLAM. Finally, we propose a framework to efficiently fuse semantic labels, obtained from a single frame, with dense SLAM, so to yield semantically coherent scene reconstruction from a single view. Evaluation results on two benchmark datasets show the robustness and accuracy of our approach.},

  abstract = {Valuable decisions and highly prioritized analysis now depend on applications such as facial biometrics, social media photo tagging, and human robots interactions. However, the ability to successfully deploy such applications is based on their efficiencies on tested use cases taking into consideration possible edge cases. Over the years, lots of generalized solutions have been implemented to mimic human emotions including sarcasm. However, factors such as geographical location or cultural difference have not been explored fully amidst its relevance in resolving ethical issues and improving conversational AI (Artificial Intelligence). In this paper, we seek to address the potential challenges in the usage of conversational AI within Black African society. We develop an emotion prediction model with accuracies ranging between 85\% and 96\%. Our model combines both speech and image data to detect the seven basic emotions with a focus on also identifying sarcasm. It uses 3-layers of the Convolutional Neural Network in addition to a new Audio-Frame Mean Expression (AFME) algorithm and focuses on model pre-processing and post-processing stages. In the end, our proposed solution contributes to maintaining the credibility of an emotion recognition system in conversational AIs.},

In this paper we show that while convolutions and attention are both sufficient for good performance, neither of them are necessary. We present MLP-Mixer, an architecture based exclusively on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). MLP-Mixer contains two types of layers: one with MLPs applied independently to image patches (i.e. "mixing" the per-location features), and one with MLPs applied across patches (i.e. "mixing" spatial information). When trained on large datasets, or with modern regularization schemes, MLP-Mixer attains competitive scores on image classification benchmarks, with pre-training and inference cost comparable to state-of-the-art models. We hope that these results spark further research beyond the realms of well established CNNs and Transformers.},

  abstract = {Although convolutional networks have been the dominant architecture for vision tasks for many years, recent experiments have shown that Transformer-based models, most notably the Vision Transformer (ViT), may exceed their performance in some settings. However, due to the quadratic runtime of the self-attention layers in Transformers, ViTs require the use of patch embeddings, which group together small regions of the image into single input features, in order to be applied to larger image sizes. This raises a question: Is the performance of ViTs due to the inherently-more-powerful Transformer architecture, or is it at least partly due to using patches as the input representation? In this paper, we present some evidence for the latter: specifically, we propose the ConvMixer, an extremely simple model that is similar in spirit to the ViT and the even-more-basic MLP-Mixer in that it operates directly on patches as input, separates the mixing of spatial and channel dimensions, and maintains equal size and resolution throughout the network. In contrast, however, the ConvMixer uses only standard convolutions to achieve the mixing steps. Despite its simplicity, we show that the ConvMixer outperforms the ViT, MLP-Mixer, and some of their variants for similar parameter counts and data set sizes, in addition to outperforming classical vision models such as the ResNet.

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

However, these models are huge in size, with millions (and even billions) of parameters, thus demanding more heavy computation power and failing to be deployed on edge devices. Besides, the performance boost is highly dependent on redundant labeled data. To achieve faster speeds and to handle the problems caused by the lack of data, knowledge distillation (KD) has been proposed to transfer information learned from one model to another. KD is often characterized by the so-called `Student-Teacher' (S-T) learning framework and has been broadly applied in model compression and knowledge transfer. This paper is about KD and S-T learning, which are being actively studied in recent years. First, we aim to provide explanations of what KD is and how/why it works. Then, we provide a comprehensive survey on the recent progress of KD methods together with S-T frameworks typically for vision tasks. In general, we consider some fundamental questions that have been driving this research area and thoroughly generalize the research progress and technical details. Additionally, we systematically analyze the research status of KD in vision applications. Finally, we discuss the potentials and open challenges of existing methods and prospect the future directions of KD and S-T learning.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from \$O(n\^2)\$ to \$O(n)\$ in both time and space.

Spatial-temporal representations can provide richer and complementary information between frames, which are crucial to distinguish the target person when occlusion occurs. This paper proposes a novel Pyramid Spatial-Temporal Aggregation (PSTA) framework to aggregate the frame-level features progressively and fuse the hierarchical temporal features into a final video-level representation. Thus, short-term and long-term temporal information could be well exploited by different hierarchies. Furthermore, a Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Module (STAM) is proposed to enhance the aggregation capability of PSTA. It mainly consists of two novel attention blocks: Spatial Reference Attention (SRA) and Temporal Reference Attention (TRA). SRA explores the spatial correlations within a frame to determine the attention weight of each location. While TRA extends SRA with the correlations between adjacent frames, temporal consistency information can be fully explored to suppress the interference features and strengthen the discriminative ones. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PSTA, and our full model reaches 91.5\% and 98.3\% Rank-1 accuracy on MARS and DukeMTMC-VID benchmarks.

Human experience can be learned through normal learning (we call it explicit knowledge), or subconsciously (we call it implicit knowledge).

Using these abundant experience as a huge database, human beings can effectively process data, even they were unseen beforehand. In this paper, we propose a unified network to encode implicit knowledge and explicit knowledge together, just like the human brain can learn knowledge from normal learning as well as subconsciousness learning. The unified network can generate a unified representation to simultaneously serve various tasks. We can perform kernel space alignment, prediction refinement, and multi-task learning in a convolutional neural network. The results demonstrate that when implicit knowledge is introduced into the neural network, it benefits the performance of all tasks. We further analyze the implicit representation learnt from the proposed unified network, and it shows great capability on catching the physical meaning of different tasks.

We also observe that, domain gap commonly exists between datasets, which essentially causes severe performance drop when training and testing on different datasets. This results in that available training data cannot be effectively leveraged for new testing domains. To relieve the expensive costs of annotating new training samples, we propose a Person Transfer Generative Adversarial Network (PTGAN) to bridge the domain gap. Comprehensive experiments show that the domain gap could be substantially narrowed-down by the PTGAN.},

  abstract = {Automatic depression detection has attracted increasing amount of attention but remains a challenging task. Psychological research suggests that depressive mood is closely related with emotion expression and perception, which motivates the investigation of whether knowledge of emotion recognition can be transferred for depression detection. This paper uses pretrained features extracted from the emotion recognition model for depression detection, further fuses emotion modality with audio and text to form multimodal depression detection. The proposed emotion transfer improves depression detection performance on DAIC-WOZ as well as increases the training stability. The analysis of how the emotion expressed by de-pressed individuals is further perceived provides clues for further understanding of the relationship between depression and emotion.},

  abstract = {Formal verification has emerged as a powerful approach to ensure the safety and reliability of deep neural networks. However, current verification tools are limited to only a handful of properties that can be expressed as first-order constraints over the inputs and output of a network. While adversarial robustness and fairness fall under this category, many real-world properties (e.g., "an autonomous vehicle has to stop in front of a stop sign") remain outside the scope of existing verification technology. To mitigate this severe practical restriction, we introduce a novel framework for verifying neural networks, named neuro-symbolic verification. The key idea is to use neural networks as part of the otherwise logical specification, enabling the verification of a wide variety of complex, real-world properties, including the one above. Moreover, we demonstrate how neuro-symbolic verification can be implemented on top of existing verification infrastructure for neural networks, making our framework easily accessible to researchers and practitioners alike.},

  abstract = {Computational prediction of facial aesthetics has attracted ever-increasing research focus, which has wide range of prospects in multimedia applications. The key challenge lies in extracting discriminative and perception-aware features to characterize the facial beautifulness. To this end, the existing schemes simply adopt a direct feature mapping, which relies on handcraft-designed low-level features that cannot reflect human-level aesthetic perception. In this paper, we present a systematic framework towards designing biology-inspired, discriminative representation for facial aesthetic prediction. First, we design a group of biological experiments that adopt eye tracker to identify spatial regions of interest during the facial aesthetic judgments of subjects, which forms a Bio-inspired Facial Aesthetic Ontology (Bio-FAO) and is made public available. Second, we adopt the cutting-edge convolutional neural network to train a set of Bio-inspired Attribute features, termed Bio-AttriBank, which forms a mid-level interpretable representation corresponding to the aforementioned Bio-FAO. For a given image, the facial aesthetic prediction is then formulated as a classification problem over the Bio-AttriBank descriptor responses, which well bridges the affective gap, and provides explainable evidences on why/how a face is beautiful or not. We have carried out extensive experiments on both JAFFE and FaceWarehouse datasets, with comparisons to a set of state-of-the-art and alternative approaches. Superior performance gains in the experiments have demonstrated the merits of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has been achieving decent performance in computer vision requiring a large volume of images, however, collecting images is expensive and difficult in many scenarios. To alleviate this issue, many image augmentation algorithms have been proposed as effective and efficient strategies. Understanding current algorithms is essential to find suitable methods or develop novel techniques for given tasks. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive survey on image augmentation for deep learning with a novel informative taxonomy. To get the basic idea why we need image augmentation, we introduce the challenges in computer vision tasks and vicinity distribution. Then, the algorithms are split into three categories; model-free, model-based, and optimizing policy-based. The model-free category employs image processing methods while the model-based method leverages trainable image generation models. In contrast, the optimizing policy-based approach aims to find the optimal operations or their combinations. Furthermore, we discuss the current trend of common applications with two more active topics, leveraging different ways to understand image augmentation, such as group and kernel theory, and deploying image augmentation for unsupervised learning. Based on the analysis, we believe that our survey gives a better understanding helpful to choose suitable methods or design novel algorithms for practical applications.},

A clear trend in deep neural networks is the exponential growth of network size and the associated increases in computational complexity and memory consumption. However, the performance and energy efficiency of edge inference, in which the inference (the application of a trained network to new data) is performed locally on embedded platforms that have limited area and power budget, is bounded by technology scaling. Here we analyse recent data and show that there are increasing gaps between the computational complexity and energy efficiency required by data scientists and the hardware capacity made available by hardware architects. We then discuss various architecture and algorithm innovations that could help to bridge the gaps. This Perspective highlights the existence of gaps between the computational complexity and energy efficiency required for the continued scaling of deep neural networks and the hardware capacity actually available with current CMOS technology scaling, in situations where edge inference is required; it then discusses various architecture and algorithm innovations that could help to bridge these gaps.},

This poses crucial questions that, do all training data contribute to model's performance? How much does each individual training sample or a sub-training-set affect the model's generalization, and how to construct a smallest subset from the entire training data as a proxy training set without significantly sacrificing the model's performance? To answer these, we propose dataset pruning, an optimization-based sample selection method that can (1) examine the influence of removing a particular set of training samples on model's generalization ability with theoretical guarantee, and (2) construct a smallest subset of training data that yields strictly constrained generalization gap. The empirically observed generalization gap of dataset pruning is substantially consistent with our theoretical expectations. Furthermore, the proposed method prunes 40\% training examples on the CIFAR-10 dataset, halves the convergence time with only 1.3\% test accuracy decrease, which is superior to previous score-based sample selection methods.},

  abstract = {A facial expression is a combination of an expressive component and a neutral component of a person. In this paper, we propose to recognize facial expressions by extracting information of the expressive component through a de-expression learning procedure, called De-expression Residue Learning (DeRL). First, a generative model is trained by cGAN. This model generates the corresponding neutral face image for any input face image. We call this procedure de-expression because the expressive information is filtered out by the generative model; however, the expressive information is still recorded in the intermediate layers. Given the neutral face image, unlike previous works using pixel-level or feature-level difference for facial expression classification, our new method learns the deposition (or residue) that remains in the intermediate layers of the generative model. Such a residue is essential as it contains the expressive component deposited in the generative model from any input facial expression images. Seven public facial expression databases are employed in our experiments. With two databases (BU-4DFE and BP4D-spontaneous) for pre-training, the DeRL method has been evaluated on five databases, CK+, Oulu-CASIA, MMI, BU-3DFE, and BP4D+. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.},

Although transfer learning has been widely used to tackle the problem, the performance degrades on new data. In this paper, we present a novel approach (so-called IA-gen) to alleviate the issue of subject variations by regenerating expressions from any input facial images. First of all, we train conditional generative models to generate six prototypic facial expressions from any given query face image while keeping the identity related information unchanged. Generative Adversarial Networks are employed to train the conditional generative models, and each of them is designed to generate one of the prototypic facial expression images. Second, a regular CNN (FER-Net) is fine- tuned for expression classification. After the corresponding prototypic facial expressions are regenerated from each facial image, we output the last FC layer of FER-Net as features for both the input image and the generated images. Based on the minimum distance between the input image and the generated expression images in the feature space, the input image is classified as one of the prototypic expressions consequently. Our proposed method can not only alleviate the influence of inter-subject variations, but will also be flexible enough to integrate with any other FER CNNs for person-independent facial expression recognition. Our method has been evaluated on CK+, Oulu-CASIA, BU-3DFE and BU-4DFE databases, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

The developed ontology allows information about the origin and meaning of the data to be modeled, i.e., time series, representing both emotional states and features derived from biosignals. Furthermore, the ROAD ontology is extensible and not application-oriented, thus it can be used to store data from a wide range of Affective Computing experiments. The ontology was validated by modeling data obtained from one experiment on AMIGOS dataset (A dataset for Multimodal research of affect, personality traits and mood on Individuals and GrOupS). The approach proposed in the paper can be used both by researchers who create new datasets or want to reuse existing ones, and for those who want to process data from experiments in a more automated way.},

State of the art approaches for automatic detection of body movements and analyzing emotions from facial features heavily rely on advanced machine learning algorithms. Most of these methods are designed for the average user, but the assumption ``one-size-fits-all'' ignores diversity in cultural background, gender, ethnicity, and personal behavior, and limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. A possible solution is to build personalized interfaces, which practically implies learning person-specific classifiers and usually collecting a significant amount of labeled samples for each novel user. As data annotation is a tedious and time-consuming process, in this paper we present a framework for personalizing classification models which does not require labeled target data. Personalization is achieved by devising a novel transfer learning approach. Specifically, we propose a regression framework which exploits auxiliary (source) annotated data to learn the relation between person-specific sample distributions and parameters of the corresponding classifiers. Then, when considering a new target user, the classification model is computed by simply feeding the associated (unlabeled) sample distribution into the learned regression function. We evaluate the proposed approach in different applications: pain recognition and action unit detection using visual data and gestures classification using inertial measurements, demonstrating the generality of our method with respect to different input data types and basic classifiers. We also show the advantages of our approach in terms of accuracy and computational time both with respect to user-independent approaches and to previous personalization techniques.},

  abstract = {Automatic speech emotion recognition (SER) is a challenging component of human-computer interaction (HCI). Existing literatures mainly focus on evaluating the SER performance by means of training and testing on a single corpus with a single language setting. However, in many practical applications, there are great differences between the training corpus and testing corpus. Due to the diversity of different speech emotional corpus or languages, most previous SER methods do not perform well when applied in real-world cross-corpus or cross-language scenarios. Inspired by the powerful feature learning ability of recently-emerged deep learning techniques, various advanced deep learning models have increasingly been adopted for cross-corpus SER. This paper aims to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive survey of cross-corpus SER, especially for various deep learning techniques associated with supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning in this area. In addition, this paper also highlights different challenges and opportunities on cross-corpus SER tasks, and points out its future trends.},

As a result, it is difficult to build effective, highly accurate and stable models using machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning models. Data augmentation has recently shown performance improvements in deep learning models with increased accuracy, stability and reduced overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation framework, named the generative adversarial network-based self-supervised data augmentation (GANSER). As the first to combine adversarial training with self-supervised learning for EEG-based emotion recognition, the proposed framework generates high-quality and high-diversity simulated EEG samples. In particular, we utilize adversarial training to learn an EEG generator and force the generated EEG signals to approximate the distribution of real samples, ensuring the quality of the augmented samples. A transformation operation is employed to mask parts of the EEG signals and force the generator to synthesize potential EEG signals based on the unmasked parts to produce a wide variety of samples. A masking possibility during transformation is introduced as prior knowledge to generalize the classifier for the augmented sample space. Finally, numerous experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can improve emotion recognition with an increase in performance and achieve state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract = {Person re-identification (reID) is a challenging task, with the purpose of matching pedestrian images with the same identity across multiple cameras. With the wide usage of deep learning methods, reID performances by different algorithms increase rapidly. However, in the presence of large pose variations, it faces two major challenges: the lack of cross-view paired training data and learning discriminative identity-sensitive and view-invariant features. To solve the above challenges, this paper proposes an image generation and classification framework for pedestrian arbitrary pose based on the combination of Pose-attention-Generative Adversarial Network(PAGAN) and Resnet50 network. Firstly, the human pose network is used to extract the pose corresponding to the pedestrian image, and the generator and discriminator of the PAGAN network are trained with the pedestrian image and its pose. The generator of the network comprises 9 pose attention transfer blocks that each transfers certain regions it attends to, generating arbitrary pose and high-quality fake images progressively, and discriminator distinguishes whether the input image is real or not. Secondly, the fake images of arbitrary pose are increased as training samples. Finally, the expanded training set is used to train the classification and recognition network to learn features related to identity but not pose, effectively improving the generalization ability of the model. The Rank-1/mAP on the Market1501 and DukeMTMC-reID datasets reach 94.1\%/85.2\% and 84.7\%/72.2\% respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has certain advantages.},

  abstract = {Emotion recognition from macroexpression and microexpression has been widely used in applications such as human\textendash computer interaction, learning status evaluation, and mental disorder diagnosis. However, due to the complexity of human macroexpressions, recognizing macroexpressions with high accuracy is a challenging task. Moreover, the short duration and low movement intensity of microexpressions make its recognition more difficult. For MM-FER (macro and microfacial expression recognition), the key information can be more efficiently expressed by a graph. In this article, a novel framework based on graph neural network named SSGNN (spatial and spectral domain features based on a graph neural network) is designed to extract spatial and spectral domain features from facial images for MM-FER, which can efficiently recognize both macroexpressions and microexpressions under the same model. SSGNN consists of two parts, SPAGNN and SPEGNN, which are used to extract spectral and spatial domain features, respectively. Experiments proved that jointly using the spectral and spatial information extracted by SSGNN can largely improve the performance of MM-FER when the training sample is limited. First, the influences of different neighbors and samples to the model performance was analyzed. Then, the contribution of SPAGNN and SPEGNN were evaluated. It was discovered that fusing the result of SPAGNN and SPEGNN at decision level further improved the performance of MM-FER. Experiment proved that SSGNN can recognize microexpression acquired by various sensors with higher accuracy under different image resolutions and image formats than the compared state-of-the-art methods in most cases. A cross-dataset experiment demonstrated the generalization ability of SSGNN.},

  abstract = {With the advent of the era of big data, the application of artificial intelligence and big data technology has led to widespread interest in facial expression recognition. In addition to the common macro-expressions in daily life, facial expressions also have an imperceptible subtle expression called micro-expressions. Micro-expression is a very fast expression, lasting only 1/25 seconds to 1/5 seconds, expressing the real emotions that people try to suppress and hide. Micro-expressions have important applications in public safety, judicial criminal investigation, clinical medicine, etc. Therefore, the research on micro-expression recognition has been increasing in recent years. In the year of 2006, Hinton's proposal of deep learning in an article in \guillemotleft Science\guillemotright{} made it appear in front of the world as a new field of machine learning, which set off a wave of deep learning. Deep learning is currently one of the hottest research directions in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and it is widely used in speech recognition, natural language processing, image recognition and other fields. Because of the characteristics of micro-expressions such as short time and subtle changes, traditional machine learning algorithms have poor robustness. Therefore, this paper summarizes the research on micro-expression recognition based on deep learning methods, mainly including some mainstream algorithms such as DBN, CNN, and discusses the development problems and trends of deep learning on micro-expression recognition, hoping to provide reference for the subsequent research in this field.},

We propose to disentangle the speaker style from linguistic content and encode the speaker style into a style embedding in a continuous space that forms the prototype of emotion embedding. We further learn the actual emotion encoder from an emotion-labelled database and study the use of relative attributes to represent fine-grained emotion intensity. To ensure emotional intelligibility, we incorporate emotion classification loss and emotion embedding similarity loss into the training of the EVC network. As desired, the proposed network controls the fine-grained emotion intensity in the output speech. Through both objective and subjective evaluations, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed network for emotional expressiveness and emotion intensity control.},

In this paper, we develop novel CNN architectures to address both challenges. First, we present a re-ID CNN termed omni-scale network (OSNet) to learn features that not only capture different spatial scales but also encapsulate a synergistic combination of multiple scales, namely omni-scale features. The basic building block consists of multiple convolutional streams, each detecting features at a certain scale. For omni-scale feature learning, a unified aggregation gate is introduced to dynamically fuse multi-scale features with channel-wise weights. OSNet is lightweight as its building blocks comprise factorised convolutions. Second, to improve generalisable feature learning, we introduce instance normalisation (IN) layers into OSNet to cope with cross-dataset discrepancies. Further, to determine the optimal placements of these IN layers in the architecture, we formulate an efficient differentiable architecture search algorithm. Extensive experiments show that, in the conventional same-dataset setting, OSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, despite being much smaller than existing re-ID models. In the more challenging yet practical cross-dataset setting, OSNet beats most recent unsupervised domain adaptation methods without using any target data.},

  abstract = {Ontology reasoning has great potential in application of domain-specific knowledge graph. However, the traditional ontology reasoner is difficult to perform rapidly reasoning on domain-specific knowledge graph as its complex logical expression and large-scale assertion set. On the other hand, the knowledge graph reasoning method based on presentation learning has better scalability, but it is hard to incorporate expert knowledge in the schema-level information effectively, so it can't implement complex reasoning. The above restricts the application of reasoning in domain-specific knowledge graph. In order to solve the problem, researchers try to combine ontology reasoning with deep learning to achieve approximate ontology reasoning. However, the state-of-the-art method has shortcomings of model design and evaluation which make it lose generalization ability. This paper proposes a novel method to transform ontology reasoning into a graph-to-graph relational mapping learning model, and realizes approximate ontology reasoning based on deep learning. Besides, this paper also defines new knowledge graph reasoning evaluation criterion, and synthesizes new test data. On this basis, relevant comparative experiments are carried out. The results show that the proposed method achieves good performance on LUBM synthetic dataset, even though the data mode that not appear in the training can also be inferred effectively, which can make the model applicable to a wider range of application scenarios.},
